The concept of time chunking, as explained by Dr. Maya Shankar, addresses a common phenomenon known as the \"middle problem.\" This middle problem refers to the decrease in motivation that individuals often experience during the midpoint of a learning bout, week, or cycle. Research has shown that motivation tends to be high at the beginning and end of a goal pursuit, with a noticeable dip in the middle phase.",

By being aware of this natural ebb in motivation, individuals can better navigate through it and emerge with renewed drive towards the end of the task. However, for those who find the middle problem particularly challenging, there are effective tools that can be employed to mitigate its effects.
