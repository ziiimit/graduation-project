One intriguing study conducted by the Knudsen Lab delved into the effects of wearing prisms on the face and how it can shift our perception of the world. By utilizing prism glasses that alter the visual field, researchers found that wearing these prisms not only causes a shift in how we see objects but also impacts our auditory motor maps.",

This shift led to a discrepancy between what they saw and where objects were actually located. For instance, an object placed slightly to the right may appear significantly further to the right due to the prism glasses' effect. The participants initially struggled to accurately reach for objects as their visual perception was distorted. This challenge was further complicated when sounds were introduced, as participants heard sounds coming from one direction while seeing the source of the sound elsewhere due to the prism glasses' influence.",
