It refers to the brain's capacity to rewire itself in response to experiences and environmental influences. The period of heightened plasticity typically extends from birth to around the age of 25, during which passive experiences shape the brain's structure and functionality through the interplay of neurotransmitters, neuronal connections, and various biochemical processes.",

These experiments have revealed that the brain's ultimate purpose is to customize itself based on the stimuli it receives from the external environment. While plasticity does not abruptly cease at a specific age, there is a gradual decline in the brain's ability to reorganize itself as individuals move beyond their mid-20s. This transition marks the need for distinct mechanisms to stimulate plasticity in adulthood.",
