Unraveling the Neural Circuitry

In a groundbreaking study led by Dr. Steinglass and her colleagues, anorexics were subjected to FMRI scans to investigate the brain areas activated during the selection of different foods. While the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex played a role in decision-making, it was the dorsal lateral striatum that became active after the decision-making process, driving the habits of avoiding certain foods and approaching others.

The striatum, a significant brain region, demonstrated a connection between the reward systems and unhealthy habit formation in anorexics. Unlike traditional models suggesting deprivation or punishment, anorexics appeared to derive a sense of reward internally by avoiding certain foods and favoring low-calorie options. This skewed reward system, possibly linked to the release of dopamine, contributed to the reinforcement of habits that supported under-eating.

The dorsal lateral striatum is part of circuits involved in go-no-go tasks, where individuals must select behaviors to perform and behaviors to suppress. Remarkably, in the anorexic brain, the reward system seemed to favor the suppression of high-calorie ingestion behaviors and the encouragement of hyper-focus on low-fat, low-calorie foods. This disruption in homeostatic processes contradicts the body's signals to eat, as the anorexic brain prioritizes habitual behaviors rewarded by the skewed reward system.

The Columbia group's work underscores the importance of intervening at the habit level, considering that anorexia has already surpassed learning and reward systems. The disrupted homeostatic processes result in low body fat, reduced leptin levels, hormonal imbalances, and compromised bone density. Educating individuals about the adverse effects of their habits or attempting to alter external influences may prove ineffective.

To address anorexia effectively, the focus must shift to rewiring the neural circuitry associated with these detrimental habits. Cognitive mechanisms, involving teaching individuals to recognize cues leading up to the habit, present a potential solution. Interoception, the ability to perceive internal states, becomes crucial as individuals learn to associate their physiological responses with interactions with different types of food. This approach targets the subconscious level at which habits operate, offering a potential avenue for intervention in the complex neural circuitry perpetuating anorexic behaviors.
