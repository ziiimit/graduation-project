The Evolutionary Roots of Eating Behavior

I recently had the opportunity to discuss the intricacies of eating behavior with Dr. Casey Halpern, a distinguished MD, Medical Doctor, and Neurosurgeon, who also holds a PhD and specializes in studying binge-eating disorder and other eating disorders, exploring their origins in the brain. Dr. Halpern has developed groundbreaking treatments for these conditions, shedding light on the perplexing question of why individuals, even with sufficient energy reserves, may still feel compelled to eat.

Our conversation delved into the primitive biology that has evolved over tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years, evident not only in humans but also in mice. Dr. Halpern emphasized that the drive to eat more than necessary is deeply ingrained in our biology and is not limited to specific eating disorders. The question of why individuals, equipped with an abundance of fat reserves and glycogen, experience hunger remains a fascinating puzzle.

From an evolutionary standpoint, Dr. Halpern explained that the impulse to eat frequently, abundantly, and rapidly makes sense. He highlighted the presence of brain circuits designed to reward such behaviors, emphasizing their origins in a time when food scarcity and the pursuit of sustenance were constant challenges, regardless of whether the food source was animal or otherwise. Every living being, humans included, possesses an innate circuit that monitors the availability of food, our current intake, and the anticipated future supply.

Dr. Halpern drew attention to the hypothalamic area called the arcuate nucleus, which houses neurons responsible for regulating hunger and satiety. When exposed to food stimuli, these neurons become active, driving hunger in response to various sensory cues and taking into account our past interactions with food, social context, and competition for resources.

Moreover, Dr. Halpern outlined the existence of an accelerator in the brain that heightens awareness and anxiety, narrowing our focus and senses when interacting with food. This primitive reflex compels us to ingest as much food as possible rapidly, reflecting an age-old survival instinct to secure sustenance efficiently.

Considering eating disorders like bulimia, Dr. Halpern proposed that they might represent an unmasking of this evolutionary mechanism, lacking the usual top-down control mechanisms that regulate typical behavior. Impulsivity, a common trait in individuals with bulimia and binge-eating disorder, further underscores the connection between these conditions and the primitive reflexes encoded in our evolutionary past.
