A Diverse Landscape

Now let's talk about the categorization for a second and why the categorization has led to now a bunch of other eating disorders as defined by the psychiatric community. One of the classic symptoms of anorexia is a loss of menstrual cycles, loss of periods. And the reason for that is when the body is undernourished, the body fat stores, send signals to the brain to inform that the body is undernourished, or they turn off the signals that say, look, there are enough body fat cells out here to support healthy metabolism. 

And therefore let's shut down ovulation, literally signal sent from the fat and muscle to the brain and the brain, the hypothalamus and pituitary will send signals down to the ovaries, or they will turn off the signals heading to the ovaries to deploy eggs, to maturation of eggs in the follicle, et cetera. So, there are instances in which people have anorexia or have bulimia, but are still maintaining at least healthy menstrual cycles. And that has led to a whole set of other categorizations of eating disorders, like binge eating disorder, where there tends to be a lot of overeating, but not the purging or categorizations of anorexia, in which people are under feeding, but they are not losing their periods.

And so these have a number of different names and acronyms. Some of them include things like, EDNOS, EDNOS is eating disorder, not otherwise specified. So, that's a sub categorization or OSFEDs. So, OSFEDs is or specified feeding or eating disorder. If you were to look online or you're looking into the psychiatric and psychological textbooks, what you would find is that there's a huge constellation of eating disorders. You can even find eating disorders like pica, where people actually ingest things like dirt or rocks or metal because they have a genuine appetite for those things. People often poisoned themselves. They often can cause structural blockages, some people have died from those sorts of things. But nonetheless, there are aspects of our brain and biology that when disrupted can lead to very bizarre types of eating behavior, sometimes pica is caused by malnutrition, but not always.
