Bulimia and Binge Eating Disorder

Bulimia and binge eating disorder are complex conditions characterized by overeating and, in the case of bulimia, followed by purging methods such as self-induced vomiting or laxative ingestion. Binge eating involves consuming an excessive amount of calories, often 10 to 30 times their daily intake, within a short two-hour period. This behavior overrides the body's signals of fullness, resembling the actions of laboratory animals with stimulated AgRP neurons, which induce excessive eating.

Clinical criteria for diagnosing bulimia or binge eating disorder involve recurrent episodes over a specific period, typically once a month for two to three months. The hallmark feature is the inability to control eating, driven by internal neurocircuitry rather than conscious decision-making. Individuals with these disorders experience an overwhelming compulsion to ingest more food than necessary, resembling a reflex that overrides homeostatic signals.

The criteria for diagnosis can be ambiguous, especially in cases where individuals engage in periodic overeating, like "cheat days." The distinction lies in the lack of control over eating, with those affected unable to make conscious decisions regarding their excessive food intake. The neurocircuitry involved seems to drive the behavior from within, leading to an uncontrollable cycle of overeating.

Various hypotheses, such as the thyroid hormone hypothesis, attempt to explain the origins of bulimia. Studies have shown fluctuating cortisol and thyroid hormone levels during binge-purge cycles, complicating the understanding of hormonal influences. The consequences of these behaviors include severe disruption to the digestive tract, alterations to the gut microbiome, and potential physical damage, including esophageal ulceration.

Bulimia is often accompanied by shame and social isolation, stemming from the difficulty in concealing purging behaviors. Contrary to some misconceptions, sexual trauma is not a prerequisite for bulimia. The distinguishing feature from anorexia lies in the lack of inhibitory control, emphasizing the neurological drive behind the compulsive overeating. Understanding these complexities is crucial for developing effective interventions and treatments for individuals grappling with bulimia and binge eating disorder.
