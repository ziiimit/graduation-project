Differentiating Bipolar 2 from Bipolar 1

The second category of bipolar disorder is bipolar 2. So BP-II or bipolar disorder 2 is somewhat different than bipolar disorder 1. First of all, it's characterized most often by the presence of both manic episodes, mania, and depressive episodes, or what's referred to as hypomania. Now, anytime in biology or in medicine you hear hypo, it's the opposite of hyper. So we've got normal hyper and hypo. Hypomania is a somewhat suppressed level of mania. So this is not going to be as extreme as the mania that we typically think of. And yet the hypo can be due to the duration, not the intensity of mania. That's right. Hypomania can mean a lessened intensity of mania, but it can also be used to refer to a shorter duration of mania. And in fact, that's one of the key criteria for bipolar 2. Bipolar 2 is often diagnosed on the basis of the presence of manic episodes that are lasting four days or even less. So someone with BP-II might have four days of this increased energy, goal-directed activity, they're irritable, they're euphoric, they're not sleeping, et cetera, but it's only lasting for about four days. Or they could be having longer extended periods of mania, but they are hypomanic episodes. They're not quite as intense so the pressured speech isn't quite as pressured. The impulsivity isn't quite as severe, et cetera.

The other aspect of bipolar 2 which is that it's often associated with the drops into the depressive episode. So people are going from manic episodes for four days or less, then they're dropping into a depression, going back to normal, manic again. I do want to point out however that people who have bipolar 1 can indeed go from manic episodes to severe, what we call major depression, so they can oscillate like a sine wave, really high highs, really low lows. And very important to understand in terms of understanding both bipolar 1 and bipolar 2 is that it's not always a sine wave. The way that bipolar disorder can present can vary tremendously between individuals. One person might go from very high highs that last seven days or more, to very low lows. Bouts of depression, major depression that can last two weeks or more. Other people are rapid cycling by way of three days manic, three days normal, three days manic, and then dropping into three days depression. So you want to erase that picture in your mind that manic bipolar disorder is this sine wave, this cycling up and down between mania and depression. It can take a lot of different forms.

And again, this is a serious challenge for the psychiatrist to diagnose people because of that fact that they're only getting a snapshot of the person unless they've known them for some time and are working with them for some time. But this is also especially important for those of you that either have bipolar depression or suspect that you might, or that know someone with bipolar depression or suspect somebody might have bipolar depression, AKA bipolar disorder. Because if you're noticing that somebody is very manic and then normal, well, that's a very different picture than somebody who's going from very manic to very deep bouts of depression. The very manic to deep bouts of depression is easier to recognize because of the extremes of those highs and lows. Now, this might seem somewhat obvious to all of you as I describe it, and yet it's very important as a, frankly, a citizen of the planet who knows other human beings to keep an eye out for these manic episodes, because whether or not it's four days or less, or whether or not it's seven days or more, these manic episodes really are the defining criteria of bipolar disorder, AKA bipolar depression.
