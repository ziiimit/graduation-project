Emerging Treatments for Bipolar Disorder

One very exciting and emerging treatment that does show great promise, and in some cases, great outcomes, for bipolar disorder is, believe it or not electric shock therapy. Electric shock therapy may sound barbaric, and in fact, it tends to look barbaric, although this is done in the controlled setting of a hospital. it turns out that this is a well-established, and in many cases, very effective treatment for major depression. Electric shock therapy is generally used for treatment-resistant depression. So these are people that have no positive response or ongoing positive response to drug therapies or other therapies. Electric shock therapy is thought to work primarily by stimulating the massive kind of indiscriminate release of things like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, a huge variety of neuromodulators, as well as things like BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor which then allows neuroplasticity to take place. Again, BDNF being permissive for neuroplasticity. The problem with ECT is that it's really only useful for treatment-resistant depression, it doesn't actually target the manic aspects of bipolar depression and bipolar disorder, but nonetheless, is used when drug treatments don't work. Some of the negatives of electric shock therapy or electric convulsive therapy, ECT, is the proper acronym and way it's described is that it's quite invasive, right? This is something that you need to go to the hospital for and oftentimes there's some inpatient care required after the electric convulsive therapy. It's a fairly high cost, especially for those that don't have insurance. And of course it requires anesthesia. For most people, that's not going to be a problem, but for many people that could be a problem. And there's often some associated memory loss. And so the memory loss, the invasive nature of ECT and the cost oftentimes rule out ECT for most patients, and that's why it's sort of a late stage or kind of last resort type thing for treatment-resistant depression.

Nowadays ketamine type therapy is done repeatedly or other treatments, for instance, transcranial magnetic stimulation which is basically non-invasive, it's a coil that's placed on the outside of the skull.And we can more accurately refer to it as repetitive or rTMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a tool that allows researchers and clinicians to reduce the amount of activity in specific neural circuits. So they can actually target the magnetic field to particular neural circuits to reduce activity in those neural circuits. Again, it's minimally invasive. It has been shown to be effective in both increasing neuroplasticity in positive ways, as well as reducing depressive episodes and in a few instances in reducing the amplitude or the intensity of manic episodes in people with bipolar disorder. The problem is it's still a very early technique. There aren't a lot of clinics and labs doing it. there are more advertisements, literally commercial clinics that are advertising rTMS or TMS. if those clinics are not either closely or maybe even distantly associated with a research institution that's really up on the latest of rTMS, you'd be wise to at least do your research, and explore, talk to other patients who've done these treatments, but certainly in university hospitals and in clinical settings and research settings, rTMS is being used as a way to, for instance, reduce the activity of certain limbic circuitries so that people are just overall less excitable and manic or to activate because it can also be used for activation now of certain neural circuits. Activate, for instance, the parietal inputs, the top down control over the limbic system. This is all happening right now. So we have ECT, repetitive TMS or rTMS. ketamine therapies, most of those are targeted toward the depressive aspects of manic depression. So for people with bipolar disorder that doesn't include depression, those are going to be less effective, but overall, it's going to be the talk therapies of the sort that we discussed earlier, or a moment ago. Plus drug treatments, almost always lithium will be explored, plus some treatments for the depressive episodes in particular if those depressive episodes are present.

Nowadays, there's a lot of excitement about psilocybin which is a psychedelic. In the US, psilocybin is still illegal. It is not legal, meaning you can get in a lot of trouble for possessing it, certainly for selling it, etc. But psilocybin is being explored as a clinical therapy in certain laboratory settings in particular, at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. It's being explored in human patients for the treatment of major depression, for OCD I believe as well, but certainly for major depression and for eating disorders. And it seems from the initial wave of publications from that work done by the incredible Matthew Johnson or Dr. Matthew Johnson. treatment of depression. Very impressive results there. And as you can imagine, very impressive results for the major depressive episodes for bipolar. However, there have not been any controlled clinical trials exploring psilocybin for the mania associated with bipolar disorder. A number of people are probably also going to wonder about whether or not cannabis or medical marijuana is useful for bipolar disorder. After looking to some previous lectures and some clinicians at Stanford Psychiatry. This question was asked of them, and as it turns out, cannabis does not seem to be effective for the treatment of the manic phases of bipolar disorder or for the treatment of the major depressive component. The only treatment perhaps, or the only situation perhaps in which it might be useful, and this is what was relayed to me, is that it may help with sleep in certain people that are having trouble with insomnia, though nowadays, it's far more common for people in manic episodes to be prescribed things like Trazodone or other benzos, benzodiazepines in order to try and get sleep within the manic episodes. And benzodiazepines and Trazodone, etc, work largely through the so-called GABA system. This is a neurotransmitter that causes reductions in excitability of neurons, hence why it's being used to try and calm people down and allow them to sleep during their manic episodes. So not a lot, or essentially no data, supporting the use of cannabis for the treatment of bipolar disorder, per se, nor data supporting the use of psilocybin for the treatment of bipolar disorder per se.
