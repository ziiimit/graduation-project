Understanding Bipolar 1 Disorder

For someone to be diagnosed as in a manic episode, they do not have to be engaging in or displaying all of those symptoms. They do however need to present at least three of those symptoms, and then in order to meet the condition of bipolar 1, they have to be presenting those three symptoms for at least seven days. It could be longer, but at least seven days. Now, this seems pretty straightforward, right? At one level, the way that I describe this and the way that it exists in the clinical literature, you could think, well, this should be pretty easy to diagnose. And yet there's a complication there or a challenge there because the psychiatrist, again, has to determine that these manic episodes are not due to something other than bipolar disorder. For instance, again, it could be TBI, traumatic brain injury, it could be seizures, or meds or other sorts of drugs. Corticosteroids, which are often prescribed for a number of immune conditions or for wound healing can also cause manic episodes. So they have to determine that everything that's happening meets the criteria I described before, three out of seven of these symptom categories for seven days or more and that it can't be better explained by something else going on in that person's life or immediate medical history. That's very important.

Now, the other challenge is that typically, when somebody is sitting in front of a psychiatrist, in particular for the first time those two people are interacting, the psychiatrist is just getting one snapshot of the person at that moment. So the person could be on day one of a manic episode, the person might be on day six of a manic episode, the person could be transitioning out of a manic episode, or the person could be suffering from a combination of manic episode where, because of the impulsivity of bipolar disorder, they went out and used illicit drugs. They also used cocaine. So the psychiatrist has a serious challenge. The psychiatrist has to determine based on a conversation, this isn't a blood test, this isn't a measurement that you can take on a scale or with a biomarker, they have to use language, a conversation with somebody who, by all accounts, is pretty impaired at conversation to determine whether or not they're suffering from a manic episode that is the consequence of bipolar disorder. You can imagine this in the real world, as somebody says, well, how long has it been since you slept? And the person starts to answer, oh, well, the other day I went down to the basement. I was going to get something out of the refrigerator and I thought I might take a nap. And then all of a sudden they're talking about something completely different. So they might not even have an answer.

So the psychiatrist has to be a really good detective, a benevolent detective, but a detective nonetheless in determining whether or not these symptoms have existed for seven days or more, and whether or not they meet the, at least three, it could be more, but at least three of the criteria of symptom categories I talked about before. Assuming that they do, assuming that the patient meets those criteria, they are likely to be diagnosed with bipolar 1. Now bipolar 1 disorder means they're having these extended manic episodes, seven days or more, but it does not necessarily mean that they are dropping into a depressive episode as well. This is a common misconception about bipolar disorder because as it's often called, bipolar disorder is referred to as bipolar depression, and yet many people with bipolar disorder don't necessarily experience the deep depressive episodes. Many of them do, but many of them do not. So somebody can truly be diagnosed accurately with bipolar one, even though they're only experiencing manic episodes and then dropping down to baseline. That's very important to understand.
