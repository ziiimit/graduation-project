Differentiating Bipolar Disorder from Borderline Personality Disorder

Borderline personality disorder can indeed present itself in ways that resemble bipolar disorder and vice versa, but there are some key distinctions that need to be made. Bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder are quite distinct in terms of their defining criteria.

The key distinction between somebody with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder is that in borderline personality disorder, there can be episodes that resemble mania or hypomania. So periods of flights of ideas, or where people are spending money excessively or sexually promiscuous in ways that seem manic or could even be a little bit manic or a lot manic, and yet more often than not, there is an environmental trigger for those manic episodes.

That is distinctly different from bipolar disorder where the person will have manic episodes without any need for a trigger. There doesn't need to be a call from someone saying, hey, let's go on a vacation together, or there's something coming up this Friday that's really exciting, or let's enter a relationship together of one form or another. The person with bipolar disorder will have episodes of mania or episodes of major depression without any need for an external stimulus or environmental trigger. But the person with borderline personality disorder, almost always, again, there's never an always in biology and psychiatry, but almost always is going to exhibit flights of mania or depressive episodes or other types of mood shifts that are dramatic and maladaptive in response to things that are coming in through the external environment or relationships of some kind.

In fact, one of the defining characteristics of borderline personality disorder is this thing that's referred to as splitting. A good example of splitting in a person with borderline personality disorder is that they will feel that they absolutely adore you and want to spend all their time with you and just think the world of you. You can do no wrong. And in fact, they genuinely can feel that way and can genuinely think that way about you. And then for whatever reason, it could be a perception of something that you did or something that you said or suspicion that you're thinking something about them, they can suddenly shift or split their emotions in what's called move you from a good object or a can do no wrong object to a bad object. They'll suddenly decide that you are cheating on them or that you are being mean to them or that you're insulting them or that something that you're doing is in violation to their self worth, their wellbeing, etc. and that can send them down a pathway of being very angry, very depressed, etc.

As I describe the contour of a person with borderline personality disorder as somebody who splits very suddenly in response to some environmental trigger, real or perceived, there's the risk, of course, that it makes the person with borderline personality disorder sound like a bad person, that they're very volatile. And while they can be volatile, I want to be very careful to point out that the person with borderline personality disorder is also suffering in this context. So while those sorts of relationships with people with borderline personality disorder, whether or not they're romantic relationships or familial or coworkers, etc., can be very challenged, can be very high friction because of the good object, bad object shifts, etc., it's bidirectional, meaning the person with borderline personality disorder, as you can imagine, is also going through a lot of suffering. At one moment, they feel as if someone is wonderful and can do no wrong to them and they want to be so strongly affiliated with them, and then in the next moment, they feel as if that person is attacking them through their actions or even through their non actions.

It's important that we distinguish borderline personality disorder from bipolar disorder, mostly on the basis of this need for a trigger. Again, in bipolar disorder, there is no need for a trigger to create a manic episode or a major depressive episode, they just happen or they can just happen. Whereas in borderline personality disorder, almost always there's an external trigger or a perception that something happened in the environment or that somebody is behaving a certain way that dramatically shifts the person with borderline personality disorder from one mode to the next.
