Nutritional Supplements for Bipolar Disorder

There are two nutrition, supplement-based approaches to bipolar disorder. They get talked about a lot, and one of them shows some interesting promise, or effectiveness even, in a limited context. Before marching into this description of these two compounds, in fact before even mentioning these two compounds. It is not wise to rely purely on talk therapy or on natural approaches to the treatment of bipolar disorder given the intensity of the disorder and the high propensity for suicide risk in people with bipolar disorder, it is a chemical and neural circuit disruption, and it needs to be dealt with head on through the appropriate chemistry and prescription drug approaches from a board-certified psychiatrist.

Now, all that is not to say that there aren't useful lifestyle interventions that can support people with bipolar disorder. of course getting better sleep, getting adequate exercise, getting proper nutrition, having quality, healthy, social interactions, even getting regular sunlight in the day and avoiding bright light at night, all of those things are going to braid together to support the nervous system and the psyche of somebody with bipolar disorder, but they braid together to support the psyche and the neurochemistry and the neural circuits of anybody and everybody. So they have generally a modulatory effect that is they're indirectly shifting the likelihood that somebody might have an episode, or the intensity of an episode, in particular, the depressive episodes. You can imagine how someone who's heading into a depressive episode, maybe they're on a lower amount of medication or they haven't yet medicated for the depressive episode of bipolar. And now they're making sure or their family is making sure that they're getting exercise, sunshine, eating correctly, social engagement, et cetera. Of course it makes perfect sense why they would have perhaps a shallower drop into depression or maybe an offset of depressive episode. That said, most all, if not all people with bipolar disorder are likely to need some sort of drug therapy intervention in order to help them. So lifestyle factors are always important in all individuals, those suffering from psychiatric conditions or not. But in some conditions of the mind and body, those lifestyle interventions can have a greater effect in offsetting symptoms, whereas in bipolar disorder, I think it's naive, and in fact, wrong to say that lifestyle interventions alone are going to prevent, especially the extreme forms of mania and depression. Again, bipolar disorder being so serious and carrying such high suicide risk, we just have to point this out again and again. Now with that said, there are two substances generally found as supplements, although there are other sources of them as well, including within nutritional sources that have been shown, at least in some studies, to be pretty effective in adjusting the symptoms of bipolar disorder, and those two things are inositol and omega-3 fatty acids.

Now inositol is a compound that is taken for a variety of reasons. It's something we've talked about on the podcast before. I personally take inositol not because I have bipolar disorder, in fact I am quite lucky that I don't have bipolar disorder, but I take inositol, a 900 milligrams of myo-inositol every third night or so in order to improve my sleep. It's something that I've added to my sleep stack. It's something that I found greatly enhances the depth and quality of my sleep. And if I wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, et cetera, it's greatly enhanced my ability to fall back asleep when I want to go back to sleep. It also seems to have a fairly potent anti-anxiety effect during the day. And as I discussed in our episode about obsessive-compulsive disorder, inositol has been used at high dosages, again, I should say myo-inositol has been used at high dosages, at levels of even 10, 18 grams, those are massive dosages by the way, to deal with certain symptoms of OCD to limited success. And I should mention that high dosages of 10 or 18 grams of inositol can cause a lot of gastric discomfort, et cetera. If you want to learn more about inositol and its various uses, I encourage you to go to examine.com where there's the so-called Human Effect Matrix, and that Human Effects Matrix will describe the many places in which myo-inositol and other forms of inositol have been show shown to be effective in, for instance, reducing anxiety, enhancing sleep and on and on.

Myo-inositol is important because myo-inositol, and we can just say inositol, is related to so-called second messenger pathways. I don't want to get too deep into second messenger pathways, but when certain substances bind, like neurotransmitters to a receptor on a cell surface, oftentimes those receptors themselves will open and allow the passage of ions and other things into a cell. Oftentimes they will engage what are called second messenger systems that is they will trigger mechanisms within the cell to then go do other things. This is probably something we should get into in real detail in a future episode for those of you that really want to nerd out on cell-cell signaling, which is a favorite topic of mine. In any case, inositol is related to a number of so-called second messenger systems, this handoff, or this kind of stimulating of changes within a cell that can inspire changes in what's called membrane fluidity, can actually make the membranes of cells, the outside fence around a cell, which is made up of fatty stuff, it can change the fluidity, meaning how readily things can float around in the membrane. You know, we think of cells as very rigid, like there's a cell, there's a neuron, or there's a immune cell, but actually those cells have a fatty outside, in particular neurons have a fatty outside. It's a thin fatty outside, it's called the cell membrane, and things are floating around in that cell membrane, but it's kind of like jello that hasn't quite fixed. And so things like receptors moving into the synapse or moving out the synapse for homeostatic plasticity, things like the ability for certain genes to be turned on in a cell or not turned on, can depend a lot on things that are happening in that cell membrane and how readily things move around in the cell membrane. One way to think about this whole picture of membrane fluidity is that just imagine that everyone of your cells has this layer, it's kind of a gelatinous-like layer and there are lots of little rafts floating around in there, but those rafts are able to move more quickly from one place to another, or get more stuck at one place or another, depending on how set that jello is. Inositol and lithium, and as we'll talk about next, omega-3 fatty acids seem to change the fluidity of those membranes, in other words, they allow things to move in and out of those membranes more readily or not. And this is no surprise given that those membranes are made out of fatty stuff. In particular, the membranes of neurons are what called a lipid bilayer, it's two layers of fat, bi means two, lipid, fat. And omega-3 fatty acids of the sort that are found in certain fish, and that fatty fish in particular, and that are found in fish oil and cod liver oil, et cetera. Omega-3 fatty acids, when we ingest them are used for a lot of different things, but they can be readily incorporated into pathways or directly incorporated into cell membranes, changing the way those cell membranes work and if those cell membranes are the cell membranes of neurons, changing the way that neurons work.

So the ability for fish oil, and in particular, the omega-3 fatty acids, which come in varieties like EPA and DHA, we'll talk about that in a moment, have been explored at relatively high dosages for their ability to offset some of the effects of mania and to offset the effects of depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. And actually, the data there are pretty impressive, although, although they are varied, meaning you will find several studies, and I'll mention a few, that found no effect of omega-3 supplementation through fish oil, usually it's capsuled fish oil, although fish oil can also be taken, excuse me, in liquid form. Oftentimes taking in liquid form is the more cost efficient way to do it. Taking in capsule form is the more palatable way to do it, because fish oil for a lot of people doesn't taste good. But nonetheless, there are several studies that have shown that supplementing with fish oil or omega-3 fatty acids at levels of, for instance, four grams per day for a period of time, this is a study that we will link in the show notes, This is Murphy at al. 2012. This is a fatty acid supplementation of 70% EPA to DHA actually worsen symptoms of mania over a period of about 16 weeks, which on the face of it makes it seem like, okay, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, very likely to not be good for bipolar disorder. And yet that was the manic phase. When one looks at some of the other studies of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, there is, for instance, a study published in 1999, this is a much higher dosage supplementation with omega-3 fatty acid, this is a 9.6 grams of fish oil per day for four months. And then actually greatly reduced symptoms of bipolar depression compared to the control group which received olive oil, olive oil is a different form of fat, monounsaturated fat but doesn't contain as much of the omega-3 fatty acids and so forth. So 9.6 grams of fish oil per day over four months is a lot of fish oil to be ingesting on a given day. This was a double blind study. This was only carried out, I should mention, in 30 subjects, but it was males and females. And the age range was pretty broad, anywhere from 18 all the way up to 64 years of age, which is important given the sort of longitudinal or changes over time, that one sees in bipolar disorder. Here's the major takeaway, supplementing with high dose omega-3s does seem to be beneficial for a good number of people with bipolar disorder. However, again, I want to highlight, however, it should not be viewed as the only treatment approach for bipolar disorder. This goes back to what I was saying before about the essential need, in most every case, for high potency prescription drug treatments prescribed by board certified psychiatrists for bipolar disorder. However, omega-3 supplementation does seem to improve or reduce the depressive symptoms in the major depressive episodes of bipolar. And there are a couple studies, and we'll link to these in the show notes as well, that show that it may even improve some of the manic episodes as well, meaning it reduces some of the manic symptoms. Now I say all this from a place of great caution, because I know, especially for listeners of this podcast, there's a lot of interest in the behavioral tools, the supplement-based tools, the nutrition tools that can support bipolar disorder, but I don't think I can overemphasize enough that especially for bipolar disorder and the great risk of suicide and suffering and inappropriate spending, or I should say maladaptive spending and impulsivity that's associated with bipolar disorder, that it's hard to imagine a scenario in which just talk therapy and fish oil and lifestyle interventions are going to completely suppress or treat bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder really need to consider the full picture of treatments, the drug treatments, the talk therapy treatments, and lifestyle treatments, and nutraceutical, or we can say supplement-based treatments such as omega-3 supplementation as a full and necessary picture for dealing with their illness.
