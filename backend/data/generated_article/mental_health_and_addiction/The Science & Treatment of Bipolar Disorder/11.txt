Effective Therapies for Bipolar Disorder

Some of the not so typical therapeutics for bipolar disorder and also point to the things that have been tried and failed for successful treatment of bipolar disorder, because some of those things are often talked about and suggested, especially in online communities, and while it's not clear that any of them are particularly hazardous on their own, although some of them do carry some hazards, it's important because of the critical time-sensitive nature of bipolar disorder and the urgency of getting treatments early to try and prevent some of the longer-lasting neural circuit changes that if people can avoid some of the less effective or demonstrated to be ineffective treatments, that they stand to combat bipolar disorder much more successfully.

First of all, a key point about drug therapies versus non-drug therapies or talk therapies, without question, drug therapies are going to be most effective when done also with talk therapies. And we'll talk about which talk therapies have been demonstrated to be most effective. In general, most psychiatrists will tell you that talk therapy on its own is rarely, if ever effective for bipolar depression and bipolar disorder, whether or not it's BP-I or BP-II. That's just the reality of it. Contrast that with obsessive-compulsive disorder. In terms of bipolar disorder, it really seems that the drug therapies are necessary, at least in most all cases. That said, talk therapies are terrific augment or support for those drug therapies and sometimes can allow people to take lower doses of those drug therapies, which turns out to be important because of the side effect profiles of a lot of drug therapies and sometimes the cost as well. I guess we can think of cost just as another side effect really. There are both established and more novel forms of talk therapy being used, again, in concert with drug treatments for bipolar disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the one that seems to be best, at least by way of the statistics and papers that exist. It's also the one that's been explored the most. So one of the reasons why it's often considered the most popular or effective is 'cause it's also been around longer and it's been explored the most. Cognitive behavioral therapy in general is a progressive exposure of the patient in a very controlled way, in a clinical setting, to some of the triggers or the conditions that would exacerbate bipolar disorder. Borderline personality disorder has all these triggers and triggered elements from the external environment, whereas bipolar disorder does not. And that's still true, but it is the case that somebody with bipolar can have worse symptoms if life conditions get worse or more stressful. So cognitive behavioral therapy, the discussion about and sometimes the direct exposure to anxiety-provoking elements of life can be very helpful for adjusting the responses to those otherwise triggering events and sometimes making the drug treatments more effective even at lower doses.

There are also forms of therapy including family-focused therapy, which is especially important in terms of bipolar disorder because family members, provided that they are not themselves in a manic episode due to the close heritability of bipolar disorder, but family members can often be excellent windows into whether or not somebody is doing well or poorly, or is veering toward or is emerging from a manic or depressive episode because they understand that person, they have a lot of data, it could be purely subjective data, but they have a lot of exposure to how long or well somebody's been sleeping or eating, etc. So family-focused therapy involves other members of the person suffering from bipolar disorder's family, as well as conversations about family members in a way that helps patients with bipolar disorder navigate, not just through manic episodes and depressive episodes, but start to learn to predict what are the conditions psychological, physical, and otherwise that can trigger bipolar episodes.

And then there's a category of therapy called interpersonal and social rhythm therapy. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, it's sort of an expansion on family-focused therapy, although it's distinct in certain ways as well, and really focuses on how people are relating to others in their life, and in the workplace, and in the school environment, and also within the family, etc. A overall theme that's emerging in psychiatry and psychology is to start wherever possible to incorporate more of the social aspects and the interpersonal aspects. In other words, not just talking to and examining a patient as one biological system, one nervous system, one set of chemicals, and one life, but rather a set of chemicals, neural circuits, and a life that's embedded in the chemicals and neural circuits and lives of other people. Just by way of example, you can imagine that if somebody is in a very healthy relationship or a very abusive relationship, that that's going to strongly impact the outcomes of manic episodes. You can imagine that if the financial situation is one in which people can recover from manic episodes, I didn't mention this earlier, but I should have, forgive me, that oftentimes people who are in a manic episode will go out and spend immense amounts of money that they simply cannot afford to lose. And then the depressive episodes that, in many cases, follow are made far worse by the financial anxiety and the financial stress that results from those manic episodes of spending, etc. And then of course, this carries over to sexual promiscuity where people might be dealing with unwanted pregnancy or STIs, or very fractured interpersonal dynamics with existing or new relationships. You can imagine how these manic episodes, as well as the depressive episodes can really wick out into an enormous amount of destruction, which brings us back to the initial criteria of BP-1 and BP-2 is that these manic episodes are not a good thing. These depressive episodes are not a good thing. They create this sense of euphoria in the person experiencing mania, or they create this sense that anything is possible. But at the end of the day, and actually every day, these episodes are quite maladaptive. They really destroy people's lives. And it's not just the life of the person that's suffering from bipolar disorder.

And so hence cognitive behavioral therapy, family-focused therapy, and interpersonal and social rhythm therapies are the primary three talk therapies that are most often combined with drug therapies in order to try and really reduce the harm. It's really all about harm reduction from manic episodes and depressive episodes.
