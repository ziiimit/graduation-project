Supplemental Approaches

Now, somewhat surprisingly, there have also been a fairly large number of studies exploring how nutraceuticals, as they're sometimes called, supplements that are available over the counter can impact the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). There's such an extensive number of different compounds and supplements falling under the category of nutraceuticals that have been explored in the treatment of OCD. I'd like to point you to a review entitled, "Nutraceuticals in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Review of Mechanistic and Clinical Evidence," published in 2011. It's over 10-years-old, and while there may be an enormous number of additional substances that could be explored by now, there are just one or two here that I want to focus on.

In this review, they delve into the effects of 5-HTP and tryptophan, components in the serotonin pathway. This makes sense given what we know about SSRIs, prompting researchers to explore how different supplements that increase serotonergic transmission might impact OCD. What you find is that 5-HTP and tryptophan do have significant effects in improving or reducing the symptoms of OCD, somewhat similarly to some of the SSRIs. However, caution is necessary. Anything that taps into a given neurochemical system to the same degree may very likely have the same sorts of side effects that a prescription drug would.

It's intriguing to think about the potential role of nutraceuticals in OCD treatment, considering the varied options explored in the past. The landscape of research may have evolved since 2011, presenting new possibilities for supplement-based interventions. As we navigate this terrain, it's crucial to approach such alternatives with both curiosity and caution, understanding that impacting neurochemical systems carries the potential for side effects akin to prescription medications. As we await more recent research developments, the intersection of nutraceuticals and OCD treatment remains an area ripe for exploration and discovery.
