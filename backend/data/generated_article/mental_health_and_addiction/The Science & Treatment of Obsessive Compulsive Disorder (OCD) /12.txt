Exploring Cannabis and CBD in the Treatment of OCD

There are other forms of drug treatments. We touched on psilocybin briefly, but there are other forms of drug treatments that have been explored for OCD. Earlier, we talked a little bit about cannabis. Why would cannabis be a place of exploration at all? Well, first of all, a number of people try and self-medicate for OCD. There is some clinical evidence, I'm not talking about recreational use, I'm talking about clinical evidence that cannabis can reduce anxiety.

Now earlier we were talking about not reducing anxiety, but learning anxiety tolerance in order to deal with and treat OCD in the context of cognitive-behavioral therapies. That doesn't necessarily rule out cannabis as a candidate for the treatment of OCD. And in fact, this has been explored. A study from Dr. Blair Simpson looked at this. This was a fairly small scale study. This is entitled, "Acute effects of cannabinoids on symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder: A human laboratory study." Very briefly, this was 14 adults with OCD. They had prior experience with cannabis.

This was randomized, placebo-controlled. The cannabis was smoked, they had different varietals, as they're called. They had a placebo. So this is basically a condition in which certain subjects consumed a cigarette that had 0% THC, others had 7% THC, other groups that is, or some had 0.4% CBD and THC. So they looked at CBD. I know a lot of people out there are interested in CBD. This is one of the few studies I could find where they explored different percentages of THC and CBD in these cannabis or marijuana cigarettes basically. The total amount that they consumed, I believe, was 800 milligrams. These, again, are not suggestions.

These are just simply reporting what's in this study. They looked at OCD symptoms, ratings. They looked at cardiovascular effects. They had a large number of different things that they explored. And I should say this study was done in 2020, and it was the first placebo-controlled investigation of cannabis in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder. And I'm just reading from their conclusions here. The data suggests that smoked cannabis, whether containing primarily THC or CBD, remember they looked at different concentrations of those, has little acute impact, meaning immediate impact on OCD symptoms and yields smaller reductions in anxiety compared to placebo.

So they did not see an ameliorative effect, an effect in reducing symptoms of OCD from cannabis or CBD, which, it's unfortunate. I think it's unfortunate anytime a treatment doesn't work. But nonetheless, those are the data, I'm sure there are going to be other studies. I want to make one additional point about cannabis CBD as it relates to obsessive-compulsive disorder. To me, it's not at all surprising that cannabis CBD did not improve symptoms of OCD.

Because in my discussion with Dr. Paul Conti a few weeks ago, Dr. Conti is indeed a medical doctor, a psychiatrist, we were talking about cannabis and its various uses, because it does have some clinical applications. And he mentioned that one of the main effects of cannabis is to tighten focus and to enhance concentration on and thoughts about one particular thing.

And in some cases that can be clinically beneficial, and in other cases that can be clinically detrimental. If you accept the idea that cannabis increases focus, and you think about OCD and the networks involved, and you think about the anxiety and the relationship between the obsession and compulsion, well, then it shouldn't come as any surprise that cannabis did not improve the symptoms of OCD because if anything, it would increase focus on the obsessions and the compulsions. Now that's not what they observed. They did not see an exacerbation or a worsening of the symptoms of OCD with cannabis, at least that's not my read of the data, but they did not see an improvement in OCD symptoms with cannabis or CBD. And to me, that's not surprising given that cannabis CBD seems to increase focus.
