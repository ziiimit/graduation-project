Mysteries of OCD Treatment

So what comes next is most certainly going to come as a big surprise, which is that despite the fact that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be effective in reducing the symptoms of OCD, at least somewhat, and certainly more than placebo, there is very little, if any evidence, that the serotonin system is disrupted in OCD. And I have to point out that this is a somewhat consistent theme in the field of psychiatry, that is a given drug can be very effective or even partially effective in reducing symptoms or in changing the overall landscape of a psychiatric disorder or illness, and yet there is very little, if any evidence, that that particular system is what's causal for OCD, or anxiety, or depression, et cetera. This is just the landscape that we're living in in terms of our understanding of the brain and psychiatry and the ways of treating brain disorders.

So as a consequence, there are a huge number of academic reviews that clinicians and research scientists have generated and read and share. One of the more, I think, thorough ones in recent years was published in 2021, This is by an truly excellent researcher from Yale university School of Medicine, I should say not just a researcher but a clinician scientist, again, an MD-PhD. This is Christopher Pittenger And the title of the review is Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies and New Targets in OCD. This is a just gorgeous review describing that the serotonin system isn't really disrupted in OCD and yet SSRIs can be very effective. The review goes on to explore even what sorts of receptors for serotonin might be involved. If it's in fact the case that serotonin is a culprit in the creation of OCD symptoms. Talk about the serotonin 2A receptor and the serotonin 1A receptor.

Why am I mentioning all that detail? because I'll just tell you right now, there is currently a lot of interest in whether or not some of the psychedelics, in particular psilocybin, can be effective in the treatment of OCD. Psilocybin has been shown in various clinical trials in particular the clinical trials done at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine by Matthew Johnson and others. He's a world class researcher on the use of psychedelics for depression and other psychiatric challenges. Currently the exploration of psilocybin for the treatment of OCD has not yielded similar results, although the studies are ongoing. Again, has not yielded similar effectiveness, but the studies are ongoing And the serotonin 2A receptor and the serotonin 1A receptors are primary targets for the drug psilocybin.

One thing I should point out is that even though serotonin has not been directly implicated in OCD, serotonin and the general systems of serotonin, the circuits in the brain that carry serotonin and depend on it have been shown to impact cognitive flexibility and inflexibility, which are kind of hallmark themes of OCD. In animals that have their serotonin depleted or in humans that have very low levels of serotonin, you can see evidence of cognitive inflexibility, challenges in tasks, switching challenges and switching the rules by which one performs a game, challenges in any kind of cognitive domain switching. And so that does indirectly implicate serotonin in some of the aspects of OCD.

Again, when one starts to explore the different transmitter systems that have been explored in animal models and in humans, it's a vast landscape, but serotonergic drugs do seem to be the most effective drugs in treating OCD despite the fact, again, despite the fact that there's no direct evidence that serotonin systems are the problem in OCD. If you recall the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop that is so central to the etiology, the presence and the patterns of symptoms in OCD, of course, serotonin is impacting that system. Serotonin is impacting just about every system in the brain, but there's no evidence that tinkering with serotonin levels, specifically in that network, is what's leading to the improvements in OCD.

However, if people go into a FMRI scanner and those people have OCD and they evoke the obsessions and compulsions, you see activity in that cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. Treatments like SSRIs that reduce the symptoms of OCD equate to a situation where there is less activity in that loop. And I should point out cognitive behavioral therapy, which we have no reason to believe only taps into the serotonin system, I think it would be extreme stretch, it would be false actually to say that that cognitive behavioral therapy taps only into the serotonin system, clearly it's going to affect a huge number of circuits in neurochemical systems. Well, people who do cognitive behavioral therapy and find some relief for OCD, they also show reductions in those cortico-striatal-thalamic loops.

So basically we have a situation where we have a behavioral therapy that works, in many people, not all, and we have a pretty good understanding of about why it works. It increases anxiety tolerance, and interference with pattern execution, getting people to not engage in the same sorts of behaviors that are detrimental to them. And we have drug treatments that work at least to some degree, but we don't know how they work or where they work in the brain. One of the things that really unifies the behavioral treatments and the drug treatments is that they take some period of time. Some relief from symptoms seems to show up around four weeks and certainly by eight weeks for both cognitive behavioral therapy and the SSRIs, but it's really at the 10 to 12 week stage when someone's been doing these twice a week, cognitive behavioral sessions, where they've been taking a SSRI for 10 to 12 weeks, that the really significant reduction in OCD symptoms starts to really show up.

I've been talking about the fact that people are getting relief from these treatments, but sadly, in the case of OCD, there is a significant population that simply does not respond to CBT or to SSRIs, or to their combination, which is why psychiatrists also explore the combination of SSRIs and neuroleptics or drugs that tap into the so-called dopamine system or the glutamate system. These are other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that impact different circuits in the brain.
