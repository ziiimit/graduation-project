Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Beyond

Another treatment that's becoming somewhat common, or at least people are commonly excited about is transcranial magnetic stimulation. So this is the use of a magnetic coil. This is completely noninvasive, placed on one portion of the skull, and one can direct magnetic energy toward particular areas of the brain to either suppress, or nowadays, you can also activate particular brain regions.

There are some interesting data showing that if TMS is applied to areas of the brain involved in the generation of motor action, so the so-called motor areas, or supplementary motor areas as they're called, while people think about or have intrusive thoughts, we know that the TMS coil can interrupt the motor behaviors, the compulsive behaviors, and at least in a small cohort of studies and a small number of patients within those studies, this has been shown to be effective, not just while the coil is on the head, of course, but after the study has been performed or the treatment's been performed in reducing OCD symptoms by disrupting the tendency for the compulsive behavior to be so automatic.

One of the key features of obsessive-compulsive disorder is that, especially if it's been around for a while, the person's been dealing with it for a while, there isn't a pattern in which the person thinks, oh, I have this contamination fear, or I need symmetry, or I'm kind of obsessed to count to the number seven. And then they pause and they go, ooh, and then they do it. No, typically there's a very close pairing of the obsession and the compulsion in time so that somebody's walking down the street, thinking one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, one, two, three, four, five, six seven, seven... and then they're doing this in such rapid succession because the obsessions are coming up so quickly. Thoughts can be generated very quickly. And then they're generating the compulsions as a way to beat down or to try and suppress that anxiety and then it comes right back up again at even stronger as I described earlier.

So transcranial magnetic stimulation seems to intervene in these various fast processes. Right now, I don't think it's fair to say that TMS is a magic bullet either. I think there's a lot of excitement about TMS and in particular, I really want to nail this point home, in particular, there's excitement about the combination of TMS with drug treatments, or the combination of TMS with cognitive behavioral therapy. And this is a really important point, not just for the sake of discussion about obsessive-compulsive disorder, but also depression, ADHD, schizophrenia, any number of different psychiatric challenges and disorders in most cases are going to respond best to a combination of behavioral treatment that's ongoing that occurs in the laboratory and clinical setting, but also in the home setting where there's homework, maybe even home visits. Drug treatments, often, not always, are a terrific augment to those cognitive behavioral therapies or other behavioral therapies.

And then now we are living in the age of brain-machine interface. You have companies like Neuralink that I think it's fair to say are going to enter the brain machine-interface world first through the treatment of certain syndromes, movement syndromes or psychiatric syndromes probably before they start putting electrodes into the brain to stimulate enhanced memory or enhanced cognition, who knows, I don't know exactly what they're doing behind the walls of Neuralink. But I have to imagine, in fact, I would wager maybe not both arms, but I'll wager my left arm that the first set of FDA approved technologies to come out of companies like Neuralink are going to be those for the treatment of things like Parkinson's and movement disorders and cognitive disorders, rather than, shall we say, kind of recreational cognitive enhancement or things of that sort. So transcranial magnetic stimulation is noninvasive. It doesn't involve going down below the skull, can have some effect, but most laboratories that I'm aware of at Stanford and elsewhere that are exploring TMS for things like OCD and other types of psychiatric challenges are using TMS in combination with drug therapies, are using, in some cases, for instance, a laboratory at Stanford, a psychiatrist, Nolan Williams, is exploring TMS in combination with psychedelic therapies, not necessarily at the same time, but nonetheless combining them or exploring how they impact brain circuitry.
