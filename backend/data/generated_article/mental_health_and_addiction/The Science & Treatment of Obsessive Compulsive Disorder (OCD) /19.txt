Understanding OCD and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder

OCD is one thing, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it's truly a disorder and it's truly debilitating and it's extremely common, and then there's this other thing called obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, which is distinct from that does not have the intrusive component so people don't feel overwhelmed or overtaken by these thoughts, rather, they find that the obsessions can sometimes serve them or they even welcome them. And I think many of us know people like this, I perhaps even could be accused or who knows, maybe have been accused of having an obsessive-compulsive personality at times. Why do I draw this distinction? Well, first of all, we've come to a point in human history, I think in large part because of social media but also in large part because there are a number of discussions being held about mental health that have brought terms like trauma, depression, OCD, et cetera, into the common vernacular so that people will say, ah, you're so OCD, or someone will say I was traumatized by that, or I was traumatized by this.

We should be very careful, right? We should be very careful in the use of certain types of language, especially language that has real psychiatric and psychological definitions because it can really draw us off course in providing relief for some of these syndromes. For instance, the word trauma is thrown around left and right nowadays. I was traumatized by this, or that caused trauma, you're giving me trauma. Listen, I realize that many people are traumatized by certain events including things that are said to them, I absolutely acknowledge that, hence our episodes on trauma and trauma treatment, several of them, in fact.

Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel, and then dedicated solo episodes with just me blabbing about trauma and trauma treatment. But as Dr. Conti so appropriately pointed out, trauma is really something that changes our neural circuitry and therefore our thoughts and our behaviors in a very persistent way that is detrimental to us. Not every bad event is traumatizing, not everything that we dislike or even that we hate or that feels terrible to us is traumatizing. For something to reach the level of trauma, it really needs to change our neural circuitry and therefore our thoughts and our behaviors in a persistent way that is maladaptive for us.

Similarly, just calling someone obsessive is one thing, saying that someone has OCD or assuming one has OCD simply because they have a personality or a phenotype, as we say, where they need things in perfect order, like I find myself correcting these pens making sure that the caps are facing in the same direction for instance right now, that is not the same as OCD. If, for instance, I can tolerate these pens being at different orientation or even throw the cap on the floor or something, it doesn't create a lot of anxiety for me. I confess, I agree it's a little bit in the moment, but then I can forget about it and move on. That's one of the key distinctions between obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder in its strictest form.

Now, once one hears that OCD is different than obsessive-compulsive personality disorder because of this difference in how intrusive the thoughts are or not, then that's useful, but it really doesn't tell us anything about what is happening mechanistically in one situation or another. Fortunately, there are beautiful data again from Dr. Blair Simpson's lab. And you can tell based on the number of studies that I've referred to from her laboratory, she's truly one of the luminaries in this field, that there really are some fundamental wiring differences and behavioral differences and psychological differences between people who have obsessive-compulsive disorder and those who have obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.

So this is a study, first author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O entitled, Capacity to delay reward differentiates obsessive-compulsive disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. And the methods in this study were to take 25 people with OCD and 25 people with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and 25 people who have both because it is possible to have both and that's important to point out, and 25 so-called healthy controls, people that don't have obsessive-compulsive personality disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. They take clinical assessments and then they took a number of tests that probed their ability to defer gratification, something called, in the laboratory, we call it delayed discounting. So their ability to defer gratification through a task where they can either accept reward right away or accept reward later. Some of you may have heard of the two marshmallow task.

This is based on a study that was performed years ago on young children at Stanford and elsewhere where they take young children into a room, they offer them a marshmallow, kids like marshmallows generally, and you say, you can eat the marshmallow right now or you can wait some period of time, and if you are able to wait and not eat the marshmallow, you can have two marshmallows. And in general, children want two marshmallows more than they want one marshmallow. So really what you're probing is their ability to access delayed gratification. And they're very entertaining, even truly amusing videos of this on the internet. So if you just do two marshmallow task video and you go into YouTube, what you'll find is that the children will use all sorts of strategies to delay gratification. Some of the kids will cover the marshmallow. Others will talk to the marshmallow and say, I know you're not that delicious. You look delicious, but no, you're not delicious. They'll engage with the marshmallow in all sorts of cute ways. They'll turn around and try to, you know, avoidance, which actually speaks to a whole category of behaviors that people with OCD also use.

It's not saying these kids had OCD, but avoidance behaviors are very much a component of OCD. People really trying to avoid the thing that evokes the obsession. Well, some kids are able to delay gratification, some aren't and it's debatable as to whether or not the kids that are able to delay gratification go on to have more successful lives or not. Initially, that was the conclusion of those studies. There's still a lot of debate about it, we'll bring an expert on to give us the final conclusion on this 'cause there is one and it's very interesting and not intuitive. Nonetheless, adults are also faced with decisions every day, all day as to whether or not they can delay gratification. And this study used a, not a two marshmallow task, but a game that involved rewards where people could delay in order to get greater rewards later.

What is the conclusion? Well, first of all, obsessive-compulsive and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder subjects both showed impairments in their psychosocial functioning and quality of life. They had compulsive behavior. So these are people that are suffering in their life because their compulsions are really strong. So it's not just being really nit-picky or really orderly in one case and having full blown OCD in the other, both sets of subjects are challenged in life because they're having relationship issues or job-related issues, etc., because they are that compulsive. However, the individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, they discounted the value of delayed gratification significantly less than those with obsessive-compulsive disorder
