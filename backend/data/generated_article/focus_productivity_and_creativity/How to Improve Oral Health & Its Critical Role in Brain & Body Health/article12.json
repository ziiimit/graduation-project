            "text": "When considering the use of mouthwash in oral hygiene practices, it is vital to be informed about the potential impact that different types of mouthwashes can have on oral health. The text explores the two main categories of mouthwashes: those containing alcohol and antiseptic mouthwashes. It is highlighted that mouthwashes containing alcohol can be detrimental to oral health as they deplete certain components of the mucosal lining of the mouth and disrupt the healthy components of the oral microbiome. This information serves as a reminder to individuals who rely on alcohol-based mouthwashes to reconsider their usage and evaluate whether these products are truly beneficial to their oral health."

While it is acknowledged that certain circumstances may warrant the use of such mouthwashes under professional guidance, there is a cautionary note regarding their potential effects on other components of oral health or the gut microbiota. It is important for individuals to consult with their healthcare professionals to understand the implications of using these types of mouthwashes and to balance the need for controlling bacterial infections with maintaining overall oral and gut health."
