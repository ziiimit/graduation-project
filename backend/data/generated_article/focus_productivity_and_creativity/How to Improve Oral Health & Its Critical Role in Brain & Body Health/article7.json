            "text": "Proper teeth brushing is a fundamental aspect of maintaining good oral hygiene, preventing tooth sensitivity, and ensuring healthy gums. While many may enjoy using a medium or hard toothbrush for a vigorous scrubbing sensation, dental professionals unanimously recommend the use of a soft toothbrush for optimal oral health. The key lies in utilizing a soft toothbrush in a circular motion on the fronts and backs of the teeth with gentle pressure to break up the biofilm layer effectively without causing harm to the gums. This gentle approach not only promotes the health of the teeth but also prevents the formation of pockets and recesses between the teeth and gums, which can lead to gum disease."

            "text": "Moreover, for individuals with tooth sensitivity, a noteworthy strategy suggested by dental and periodontal experts is to lightly brush the gums. Brushing the gums stimulates blood circulation to the deeper components of the tooth, providing essential nutrients to the live and active tissues within the tooth structure. This increased blood flow can enhance the resilience of the teeth and reduce sensitivity to hot and cold stimuli. While it may be overlooked by many, incorporating gentle gum brushing into the oral care routine can yield significant benefits, particularly for those with sensitive teeth."

It is essential to use a soft toothbrush or, if using an electric toothbrush, apply minimal pressure and keep the bristles in contact with the teeth and gums. By promoting circulation to the deeper cavities of the tooth, brushing the gums can contribute to overall oral health and help prevent issues such as gum disease."

By following the recommendations of dental professionals and incorporating gentle brushing practices into daily oral care routines, individuals can effectively protect their oral health and reduce the risk of developing dental problems related to improper brushing methods."
