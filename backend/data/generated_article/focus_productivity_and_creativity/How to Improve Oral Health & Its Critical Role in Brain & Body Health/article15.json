            "text": "Promoting a healthy gut microbiome can have a direct impact on preventing and healing canker sores. The link between the gut microbiome and oral microbiome plays a significant role in the formation of canker sores. To support a healthy gut microbiome, it is recommended to consume one to four servings of low sugar fermented foods per day. These foods can include items such as yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and kombucha. Additionally, incorporating enough prebiotic fiber into the diet, either through fruits and vegetables or supplements, can further support gut health. In cases of dysbiosis or after taking antibiotics, probiotic supplements may also be beneficial, although they should not be taken consistently."

Dr. Mark Burhen, a respected figure in the field of dental and oral health, emphasizes the importance of getting at least 6 to 8 hours of quality sleep each night. Sleep not only supports the health of the gut and oral microbiome but also has a positive impact on mental health, physical health, and performance."
