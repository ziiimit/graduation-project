It plays a crucial role in emotions, bonds, and social connections. Released in response to various stimuli such as lactation in females, sexual interactions, and non-sexual touch, oxytocin is not limited to a specific gender but is present in both males and females. One of its key functions includes facilitating pair bonding and the establishment of social bonds.",

This mechanism of action supports the notion that oxytocin may play a role in increasing awareness of one's partner's emotional state. By focusing on the interaction between alertness and calmness, as well as the interoceptive and exteroceptive axes, oxytocin appears to be instrumental in fostering social bonds.",
