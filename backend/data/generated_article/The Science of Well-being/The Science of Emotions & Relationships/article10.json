Interoception refers to the awareness of internal bodily sensations, such as heartbeat or breathing, while exteroception relates to focusing on external stimuli in the environment. The exercise aims to help individuals become more aware of where their attention is directed and to practice shifting focus between internal and external stimuli.",
