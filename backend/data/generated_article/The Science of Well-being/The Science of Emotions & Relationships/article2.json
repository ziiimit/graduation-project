As infants, we lack the cognitive ability to comprehend the external environment, and our interactions are mainly based on cues and responses to our internal feelings, particularly anxiety. When we experience discomfort such as hunger or the need for a diaper change, we express agitation through vocalizations or cues. In response, our caregivers, guided by their instincts and experience, interpret these signals and address our needs accordingly, providing us with food, warmth, or comfort.",
