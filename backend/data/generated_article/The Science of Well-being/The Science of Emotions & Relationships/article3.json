They are a reflection of our ability to form bonds with others and make sense of the world around us. According to the text, emotions are primarily about forming connections and being able to anticipate events in our environment. As babies, we rely on caregivers to provide us with the care and attention we need to develop emotionally. This early nurturing is fundamental in laying the foundation for healthy emotional development.",

We may struggle to articulate our feelings in words, let alone interpret the emotions of others accurately.
