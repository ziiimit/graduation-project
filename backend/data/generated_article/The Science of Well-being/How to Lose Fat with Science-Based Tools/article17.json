This practice is believed to stimulate the mind and body and promote resilience. Those who engage in regular cold water swims often develop cold adaptation, where they no longer experience the release of epinephrine and adrenaline in response to cold exposure. As a result, the release of succinate, along with shivering and the activation of brown fat thermogenesis, becomes less intense over time.",

There were even discussions about the potential of irisin as a fat loss drug.
