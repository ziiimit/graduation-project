The idea that high doses of Vitamin C can help reduce the duration of colds or flu has been a topic of interest for many. However, recent research has shed some light on this topic. While some studies suggest that high doses of Vitamin C, around 6,000 to 8,000 milligrams per day, may have a slight effect on colds or flu, it is essential to note that the evidence is not robust. Additionally, a recent study published in 2023 highlighted issues with a meta-analysis suggesting benefits of Vitamin C supplementation for colds and flu, ultimately leading to its retraction due to data analysis flaws. Therefore, the effectiveness of high doses of Vitamin C for preventing or treating colds and flu remains uncertain. ",

            "text_en": "On the other hand, Vitamin D has gained attention for its role in immune function. Research indicates that individuals with low levels of Vitamin D are more prone to acute respiratory tract infections. While supplementation with around 1,000 to 2,000 IU of Vitamin D daily is generally considered safe for most people and may help maintain adequate levels, some individuals might require higher doses to meet their specific needs. However, high doses of Vitamin D should be approached with caution to prevent potential negative effects. It is important to note that while studies suggest a possible reduction in the risk of respiratory infections with Vitamin D supplementation, it may not be the sole factor in immune system function. Factors like regular sunlight exposure, which aids in the natural production of Vitamin D in the body, as well as supporting overall well-being, play a significant role in immune health.",
