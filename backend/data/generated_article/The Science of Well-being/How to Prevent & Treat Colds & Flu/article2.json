There are three main categories of flu viruses: type A, type B, and type C. These variations are based on the different proteins expressed on their surface. For example, the Spanish Flu, a devastating pandemic that occurred between 1918 and 1920, was caused by a type A H1N1 virus. It's important to note that the common flu viruses fall under the category of type A, which is responsible for causing seasonal flu outbreaks.",

The flu virus can be contracted by being exposed to respiratory droplets from an infected person's sneeze or cough. It can also be transmitted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the face, allowing the virus to enter the body through mucous membranes. Unlike the cold virus, the flu virus can only survive on surfaces for about two hours. This means that direct contact with an infected individual is the primary mode of transmission.",

Studies have shown that getting the flu shot can reduce the risk of contracting the prevalent flu strain by 40% to 60% in a given season.
