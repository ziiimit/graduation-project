            "text_en": "The flu and cold viruses are known for their cunning ability to spread from one host to another even before any symptoms manifest. This means that individuals who seem healthy can unknowingly transmit these viruses, serving as vectors for contagion. The viruses, despite lacking brains, have evolved to effectively propagate and infect more hosts. They thrive by making individuals cough, sneeze, and experience symptoms such as headaches and fever, with the peak of contagiousness aligning with the time when symptoms are most severe. Understanding this period of heightened contagion can aid in taking necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of these illnesses.",
