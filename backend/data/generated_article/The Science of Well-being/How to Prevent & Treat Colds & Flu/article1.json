Different individuals may experience varying degrees of severity in symptoms, such as a runny nose, stuffy head, and even fever. It is important to note that individuals typically develop symptoms one to two days after being exposed to the cold virus. However, not everyone who is exposed will necessarily become infected. The immune system plays a crucial role in fighting off the virus, which means that exposure does not equate to catching a cold. Strengthening the immune system through scientifically supported methods can significantly decrease the likelihood of falling ill even when encountering a new serotype of the cold virus.",

Contrary to popular belief, even when symptoms start to improve, one can still be contagious if signs of the cold persist. Therefore, it is imperative for those experiencing a cold to stay at home and minimize contact with others whenever possible, especially in shared environments like workplaces, gyms, and households. This proactive approach not only aids in preventing the spread of the virus but also helps in reducing the economic, mental, and physical burdens associated with cold infections.",
