The microbiome, which consists of trillions of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in supporting the immune system. While much attention has been given to the gut microbiome, it is essential to recognize that the microbiome also exists in other areas of the body, including the nasal passages.",

Nasal breathing provides the ideal environment for the microbiota in the nasal passages to thrive and offers a natural defense against colds and flu viruses.
