            "text_en": "The mouth, gums, and saliva play essential roles in maintaining our overall oral health and systemic well-being. The enamel layer of the teeth is crucial, as it can either demineralize or remineralize. This process is influenced by the acidity of the mouth, which is closely tied to saliva production and its mineral content. Saliva serves as a protective barrier, helping to maintain the proper pH level in the mouth, which is necessary for keeping harmful bacteria at bay and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria. This balance is vital for oral health, as it can prevent issues such as tooth decay and gum disease.",

            "text_en": "The gums, or gingiva, are often overlooked in their importance for dental health. They provide stability for the teeth by acting as a seal between the oral cavity and the underlying bone and bloodstream. Gums play a critical role in maintaining the position of the teeth and protecting them from harmful bacteria. The presence of gum disease can lead to severe consequences, such as periodontal disease, which has been linked to systemic conditions like Alzheimer's and cardiac issues. Thus, understanding the significance of maintaining healthy gums is crucial for overall health and well-being.",
