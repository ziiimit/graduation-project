Research suggests that there are optimal times during the day, especially in the morning and throughout the day, when the mouth produces the maximum amount of saliva with the ideal pH for promoting teeth remineralization. Intermittent fasting, which involves abstaining from food for extended periods, might provide a beneficial environment for this process by allowing saliva to support remineralization without being altered by food consumption. Creating time gaps between meals, limiting acidic liquid intake, and practicing intermittent fasting could potentially aid in maintaining oral health by supporting the natural remineralization process of teeth.",

            "text_en": "Moreover, nighttime tooth care practices have been emphasized as crucial for oral health. During the night, saliva production significantly decreases, reducing the mouth's ability to combat harmful bacteria that can lead to tooth decay. Therefore, brushing, flossing, and cleaning the mouth before going to sleep have been underscored as essential steps to remove any food particles and minimize the risk of bacterial growth overnight. Dental professionals advocate for nighttime dental hygiene routines as vital for preventing cavities and maintaining overall oral health, especially for individuals who may not brush or floss as frequently as recommended.",
