            "text_en": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) encompasses a wide range of categories that can be classified into three main types: checking obsessions and compulsions, repetition obsessions and compulsions, and order obsessions and compulsions. The checking obsessions involve behaviors such as repeatedly checking locks or stoves, which are common actions that people without OCD may also engage in to a lesser degree. However, individuals with OCD may feel compelled to perform these actions multiple times, sometimes to the point where it becomes a significant challenge for them to move on with their day without completing their compulsions.",

This type of OCD can manifest in various ways, as seen in an example involving a band member who felt the need to walk up and down stairs a certain number of times before being satisfied. These repetitive behaviors, while seeming irrational to others, are significant manifestations of OCD that can significantly impact an individual's daily life.",
