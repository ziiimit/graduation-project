While there are exceptions, a substantial body of evidence underscores the negative impact of ingesting high amounts of these highly palatable and processed foods, especially for children. Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California San Francisco, has been pivotal in highlighting the dangers associated with hidden sugars and highly processed foods.",
