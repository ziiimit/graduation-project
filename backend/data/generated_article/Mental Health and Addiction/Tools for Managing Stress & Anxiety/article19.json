            "text_en": "Medium-term stress can be defined as a type of stress that persists for a period ranging from several days to several weeks. This form of stress lies in between short-term stress, which lasts for a brief period, and long-term stress, which is endured over an extended timeframe. In the face of medium-term stress, individuals often find themselves tackling multiple responsibilities and tasks simultaneously. The body's response to stress, including medium-term stress, involves the release of adrenaline, which triggers the immune response, thus aiding in combating potential infections.",
