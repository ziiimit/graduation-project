            "text": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew Huberman. And I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford. It is however, part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science and science-related tools\nto the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker analyzes your blood and DNA to give you an accurate assessment of your health and your biological age. There are many things about our health that can only be analyzed\nfrom blood and DNA tests. I've been getting my blood\nassessed for many years now. And about a year ago, I\nswitched to InsideTracker. What I like about InsideTracker is that you get all this information back about metabolic factors,\nendocrine factors, et cetera, that are really important to your health. But unlike a lot of blood tests where you just get all the\nnumbers back and it tells you whether or not things\nare high, normal, or low, InsideTracker also has this really useful and really easy-to-use dashboard that takes the information\nfor your blood and DNA tests and points you toward particular\nbehavioral, nutritional, and other sorts of\nprotocols that you can use to get the numbers where you\nwant them for your health. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman and they will give you 25%\noff any of their programs. Again, their programs allow\nyou to assess your health from the inside, things that you could just never assess from any kind of test that\ndidn't involve blood and DNA. And it also has this\nreally interesting feature that it can measure your inner age, which is based on biology. Your chronological age, of\ncourse, is very informative about your health and\nwhere you ought to be in terms of health\nmetrics, but people vary. We know people, of course, that are in their late\n90s who are doing well. We know people that are in\ntheir 50s who are struggling or even in their 20s. So, blood and DNA are the\nway to analyze your health. That's my belief. That's why I use InsideTracker. So, go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of their products and use \"Huberman\" at checkout. Our second sponsor of today's\nepisode is Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are ideally suited to your needs for the best night's sleep possible. I switched to using a Helix\nmattress and Helix pillow this last year and I'm sleeping better\nthan I ever have before. The way that Helix mattresses work and the reason they're different, is that they are tailored to\nyour individual sleep style. Your sleep style can be assessed\nby going to their website, you take a brief two-minute\nquestionnaire quiz. Asks you questions like,\ndo you sleep on your back or your side or your stomach? Maybe you don't know or maybe you move around\na lot during the night. It also asks you questions\nsuch as do you tend to run hot or wake up cold, things of that sort. And then they tailor a particular mattress to your sleep needs. For me, I matched to the\nso-called Dusk, D-U-S-K mattress. And I love it. I sleep better than ever. And right now, if you\nwant to try Helix Sleep you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll\nget $200 off your order plus two free pillows. They also have a great warranty. They have a 10-year warranty\non their mattresses. If you don't like the\nmattress for any reason, they'll pick it up for\nfree from your home. And they just make the whole\nthing really easy to try and determine whether or\nnot it's right for you. So again, it's helixsleep.com/huberman\nto get $200 off and two free pillows on your first order. Some of you have asked how you\ncan help support the podcast in yet other ways, besides\njust checking out our sponsors. We really appreciate the question and we've set up a Patreon account at patreon.com/AndrewHuberman which allows you to donate to the podcast at a variety of different levels. We have, for instance, the 5-HTP, which is in honor of a serotonin. 5-HTP is the name for serotonin that it allows you to donate $5 per month. We have the circadian, which as many of you, of course,\nwill know is 24-hour day. So, you can donate $24\na month if you like. You can also pick any value that you want. We even have the Costello,\nwhich is $10 a month which allows you to support the podcast in honor of Costello. The fact that he's 10 years old, that he eats 10 pounds of food a day, and the fact that he takes\n10 one-hour naps per day ",

            "text": "on average. So again, that's\npatreon.com/AndrewHuberman if you'd like to support\nthe podcast that way. Today's episode is going to be all about the science of emotions. The first month of the podcast, we talked about sleep and wakefulness. Last month, we were talking\nabout neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change\nin response to experience. And this month we're going to talk about these things that we call emotions. We're going to decipher what\nthey are, how they work, how we can control them when we might not want to control them. There are going to be\nfour episodes on emotions. And today, we're going\nto talk in particular about something that most\noften is called stress. Now, you might be thinking,\n\"Wait, stress isn't an emotion.\" But stress really lies at\nthe heart of whether or not our internal experience\nis matched well or not to our external experience\nwhere the events that are happening to us and around us. And as you'll soon, see\nthose converge or combine to create what we call emotions. Now, I want to be very clear that we're going to talk\nabout the biology of emotions, we're going to talk a little bit about some psychological\nconcepts related to emotion, and we are definitely going to talk about tools to control what we call stress or commonly think of as stress. We're also going to clean up\nsome common myths about stress. For instance, that stress\nimpairs your immune system. That's true in certain contexts. And in other contexts, stress actually enhances\nyour immune system and makes it function better. There is going to be a lot of discussion about whether or not our internal state, whether or not we are alert\nor calm is good or bad, depending on the circumstances. So, where we're headed here is I'd like you to come\naway from today's episode with what I call an organizational logic, a framework for thinking\nabout these things that typically we just call happy or sad or depressed or anxious. And I'm going to make\nsure that you have tools that are grounded in\nphysiology and neuroscience that will allow you to navigate\nthis otherwise complex space that we call emotions that will allow you to\nground yourself better when you're feeling like\nlife is weighing on you, where you're kind of being\npulled by the currents of life as well as to support other people whether or not that's in\na psychological practice if you're a practitioner, or\nyou have clients or children or spouses, really, to be\nable to support other people in your environment better. And the tools that I'm\ngoing to focus on today range from behavioral tools. We will talk about some\nof the more valuable supplementation tools that are out there. And we're going to talk a little bit about things like depression, PTSD, but we will be devoting entire episodes to things like depression,\nPTSD, and even attention deficit and obsessive compulsive disorder, which believe it or not, although this might not\nsurprise many of you, have a very strong emotional component. It's just not just about\ncompulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts. It's also about the emotional\nload of being in that state. So, I promise that today\nwe're going to clean up a lot of misunderstanding. We're going to give you a lot of tools and you're going to learn a lot about the biology of how your\nbody and brain work together. Because if ever there was a topic that brought together the brain and body or mind-body relationship,\nit's stress and emotions. It's also the positive emotions. When we feel something, whether or not we're super happy or just feeling kind of pleasant or we are feeling stressed,\nanxious, and overwhelmed, it isn't just in our head. It's also in our body. And as you may recall, the nervous system, which includes the brain and\nthe eyes and the spinal cord, but also all the connections\nwith the organs of the body includes the brain and body. And those organs of the body, your gut, and your liver, and your spleen, they're also communicating with the brain. So, I look forward to a day, in fact, when we no longer think about neuroscience as just the brain. And many neuroscientists now also think about the body, of course. And the brain controls the body, but the body is also\nhaving a very profound and concrete influence on the brain. I think up until recently,\npeople would hear about kind of brain-body and\nalways think about mindfulness. We're actually not going to talk that much about mindfulness at all today. Mindfulness is kind of a\nvague concept, in fact. When you think about mindfulness, it's good to take the opposite. What's the opposite of mindfulness? Would be mindlessness. Well, all of a sudden we're into territory that isn't really easy for one person to describe their experience or to help others with their experience. Today, we're going to\ntalk about objective tools that match the brain-body experience or separate the brain-body experience in ways that leverage your\nability to lean into life better, to feel better, literally\nto just feel better about what you're experiencing, and believe it or not, to be\nable to control your emotions when that's appropriate. This isn't about becoming robotic. This isn't about trying not to feel human. This is actually about being\nable to lean into life better as a consequence of being able to control some of your inner real estate. This nervous system that\nincludes the brain and body and how that nervous system is interacting with the outside world. So, it's to place you in a\ngreater position of power. And so, let's get started in\ndeciphering what is stress, ",

        {
            "text": "what are emotions, and why did\nI batch stress and emotions into one discussion today? Okay. So, what is stress? We hear all the time that stress is bad. We hear people saying\nthey're really stressed out. What is stress? You've all presumably heard\nthe arguments or the framework that stress is this horrible\nancient carryover over from times in which humans\nwere pursued by animals or other human predators and that whenever we\nfeel what we call stress or feel stressed out, that it's just this unfortunate\ninvasion of something that we no longer need in modern life, that this was designed for\nwhen we were being attacked by bears or tigers or\nlions or whatever it is. And gosh, what an unfortunate thing. And we have so many\ncreature comforts nowadays, but we have not eliminated this stress. Almost as if it was like an\norgan or a system in our body that was bad for us, that we're stuck with just because of the species that we are. But first of all, all\nspecies experience stress. And I think that it's fair to say even though I wasn't there, that yes, in fact, throughout\nour evolutionary history, we were vulnerable to animal attack and other human attacks on a regular basis up until a point where we\nstarted developing weapons and structures and fire and other things that allow us to protect ourselves better from those animals and\ninvaders of various kinds. But it is entirely naive for us to think that in ancient times, ancient times being kind of loose term for previous on medieval times, 100 years ago, 1000 years\nago, 10,000 years ago, of course, there were infidelities, right? Partners cheated. People died. In fact, before the advent of phones, which we're going to talk about today, you can imagine that someone\nmight head off on a hunt or to go visit a relative\nand never come back and you would never know why. That would be very stressful. So, there was psychosocial stress. There was the stress of losing loved ones. There was the stress of cold, of famine. There was the stress\nprobably also of just worry. This idea that ancient versions of humans 1000 years ago, 100\nyears ago didn't worry, I think that is entirely inconsistent with everything we know\nabout the structure of the human brain 100\nyears, 1000 years ago. So, all the problems that\nwe're struggling with existed forever. It's just that stress at its\ncore is a generalized system. It wasn't designed for tigers attacking us or people attacking us. It's a system to mobilize\nother systems in the brain and body. That's what stress really is. It's designed to be generic. And that's the most important thing that I'd like you to understand today, is that the system that\ngoverns what we call stress is generic. It wasn't designed for one thing. And that gives it a certain advantage in taking over the state\nof our brain and body, but it also gives you, all of us an advantage in controlling it because it's based on\nhard-wired biological mechanisms and there are hard-wired\nbiological mechanisms, meaning cells and chemicals\nand pathways and tissues that exist in you right now\nthat require no neuroplasticity that allow you to put a brake on stress. And so, we're going to talk about those. So, you have a system for stress and you have a system for\ndistress that are baked into you. They were genetically encoded. And you were born with them\nand you still have them now. So, if you're alive and listening, you have the capacity\nto control your stress. And today, I'm going to talk about ways that you can control your stress, not just by doing some\noffline practice of meditation or breath work or something like that, but real-time tools. Tools that allow you\nto push back on stress when stress hits in real time. ",

            "text": "This is something that\nmy lab works actively on in developing and testing these tools and evolving these tools. And there are other laboratories\nthat do this as well. So, let's talk about the stress response. And by doing that, you\nwill understand exactly why the tools I'm going to give you work. For those of you that are saying, \"Wait, I just want the tools. Just give me a summary,\" trust me, if you understand mechanism, you are going to be in\na far better position to incorporate these tools, to\nteach these tools to others, and to modify them as your\nlife circumstances change. If you'd like the cheat sheet or you just want the one-page PDF, eventually we'll get\nthat stuff out to people, but it's really important to understand the underlying mechanism. Okay. So, what is stress? Well, let's just distinguish\nbetween stressors, which are the things that stress us out, and stress, which is the psychological and physiological response to stressors. I'm mainly going to talk about stress, which is your response to things. Let's be clear about what we already know, which is that stressors\ncan be psychological or they can be physical. Okay? If I put you outside on a\ncold day without a jacket for a very long time, that is stressful. If I have you prepare for\ntoo many exams at once and you can't balance it\nall with your sleep schedule and your other needs for\ncomfort and wellbeing, like food, rest, sleep,\nand social connection, that is stressful. So, stress, and as I\nmentioned before, is generic. It doesn't distinguish between physical and emotional stress. So, what happens when\nthe stress response hits? Let's talk about the immediate or what we call the acute stress response. We could also think of\nthis as short-term stress. So, you have a collection of neurons. They have a name. It's called the sympathetic chain ganglia. And it has nothing to do with sympathy. Sympa means together. And there's a group of neurons that start right about at your neck and run down to about your\nnavel, a little bit lower, and those are called the\nsympathetic chain ganglia. You don't need to memorize that name. There will not be a quiz. But it's important to know that\nin the middle of your body, you have a chain of neurons that when something stresses us out, either in our mind or because something\nenters our environment and we see something that stresses us out, that we don't like heights\nif you're afraid of heights, somebody you dislike walks\ninto the room, et cetera, that chain of neurons becomes activated like a bunch of dominoes\nfalling on all at once. It's very fast. When that happens, those neurons release a\nneuromodulator neurochemical that I've talked about\nbefore on this podcast called acetylcholine. They release that at various\nsites within the body. Now, this is important because normally, acetylcholine would be\nused to move muscles. Actually, every time we move a muscle, pick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen, walk down the street, it's spinal neurons connecting to muscle and releasing acetylcholine. So, in the brain it's involved in focus and it muscles is involved\nin making muscles twitch. But if we were stressed, we wouldn't want all our\nmuscles to contract at once because we would just be kind\nof like paralyzed like this in what tonic activation, as it's called. We wouldn't want that. Something called tetanus,\nbelieve it or not. because the tetanus toxin\nwill cause that kind of rigor of the entire body. You do not want that. When those neurons are activated,\nacetylcholine is released, but there are some other neurons for the aficionados out there. They're called the postganglionic neurons. Those ones respond to that acetylcholine and then they release epinephrine, which is the equivalent to adrenaline. So, we have this system\nwhere it's very fast whenever we're stressed, the core of our body, these neurons down the middle of our body release these chemicals and then there's adrenaline or epinephrine released at particular organs\nand acts in particular ways. We're going down into the weeds here. So just stay with me because\nit's going to make a lot of sense and you will appreciate\nhaving this knowledge in hand. That epinephrine acts\nin two different ways. Some things like the muscles\nof your legs and your heart and other things that need to be active when you're stressed, they have a certain kind of receptor which is called the beta receptor. And that beta receptor\nresponds to epinephrine and blood vessels dilate. They get bigger and blood\nrushes in to our legs. The heart rate speeds up. Lots of things happen that get activated. And at the same time, that epinephrine activates other receptors on certain tissues that we don't need. The ones involved in\ndigestion, reproduction, and things of that sort that are luxuries for when things are going well, not things to pay attention\nto when we're stressed. And that binds to other receptors that contract the blood vessels. So, basically the stress response, this is the key phrase here, the stress response A, is\ngeneric, I said that before, and B, it basically pushes\ncertain systems to be activated and other systems to not be activated. So, the stress response is two-pronged. It's a yes for certain things and it's a no, you may not\nright now for other things. So, that's the key thing to understand about the stress response. That's why your heart speeds up. That's why you feel\nblood in certain organs and tissues of your\nbody, but not in others. That's why your throat goes dry because it turns out that\nwhen you get stressed, the salivary glands are shut down. There's a lot less blood flow to the neurons that control salivation. And so, you're going to start swallowing. You feel like your throat is getting dry. There are a lot of different effects. I'm not going to list them\nall off, but basically, you are activated in ways\nthat support you moving. So, that's the third thing. It's first of all, it's generic. Second of all, the stress\nresponse, activate certain things and shuts down other features of our body. And then it's a sense of agitation that makes you want to move. And that's because fundamentally, the stress response is\njust this generic thing that says do something. And movement in this case\ncan either be the bias to move in terms of action, or it can be the bias to say something. When we are stressed, we are\nmore likely to say something that probably we shouldn't say. We are more likely to move. And if you're trying to suppress movement, you'll feel that as a tremor. You're going to feel agitated and that's because it\nwas designed to move you. So, this is important because\nif you want to control stress, you need to learn how to\nwork with that agitation. ",

            "text": "I'd like to give you a tool at this point, because I think if we go any further with a lot more science, people are going to begin to\nwonder if this is just going to be a kind of standard university lecture about the stress response. I'm going to give you more\nsigns about the stress response, but I want to take what\nwe now already know about the stress response and use that as a framework\nfor thinking about how one might reduce or even\neliminate the stress response quickly in real time, should\nit arise when we don't want it. So, we're taking the podium or we're sitting down at a Zoom call, and all of a sudden we're feeling flushed. We're feeling like our heart is racing. We're feeling a little too alert. We're feeling a little worked\nup and we want to calm down. As far as I am aware of, the best tools to reduce stress quickly, so-called real-time tools\nare going to be tools that have a direct line to the so-called autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous\nsystem is a name given to the kind of general\nfeatures of alertness or calmness in the body. Typically, it means automatic. Although we do have some control over it at certain what so-called\nleavers are entry points. Here's what doesn't\nwork to control stress. Telling yourself to calm down. In fact, that tends to\njust exacerbate stress. Telling someone else to calm down also tends to exacerbate their stress. If you want to reduce the\nmagnitude of the stress response, the best thing you can do is activate the other system in the body which is designed for\ncalming and relaxation. And that system is called the parasympathetic nervous system. Because as I mentioned before, the neurons that control stress run from about your neck to your navel. The parasympathetic neurons,\npara just means near, exist in, they're some\nof the cranial nerves. So, it's kind of left\nneck and lower brainstem. Kind of back of the brain and in the neck and in the pelvic area. And the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem is really interesting because especially the cranial nerves, the ones that are up in the\nbrainstem and in the neck area, those have a direct line to\nvarious features of your face, in particular, the eyes. They control things like eye\nmovements, pupil dilation, things of that sort, as well as the tongue, the\nfacial muscles, et cetera. The parasympathetic nervous system, many people don't realize this, is the system by which we\ncontrol the face and the eyes, and to some extent, our\nairway, the trachea. And it's these neurons that\nreside within the pelvic area. Now, the neurons within the pelvic area are involved in control of\nthe genitals, the bladder, and the rectum. And those don't have a direct line. You don't have a direct\nway to control those. It actually has to go\nfrom brain to spinal cord and then out to those organs. Whereas the parasympathetic nervous system has certain entry points\nor what I'll call leavers that will allow you to push\nback on the stress response ",

So, I'm going to teach\nyou the first tool now, so I don't overwhelm you with\nall this academic knowledge without giving you something useful. And the tool that at least to\nmy knowledge is the fastest and most thoroughly grounded\nin physiology and neuroscience for calming down in a self-directed way is what's called the\nphysiological sigh, S-I-G-H. Now, some of you might've\nheard me talk about this on previous podcasts, but I'm going to explain\nthis in the context of how respiration in general\nis used to calm us down. And turns out you're all\ndoing this all the time, but you are doing it involuntarily. And when you stress, you tend to forget that you can also activate\nthese systems voluntarily. This is an extremely\npowerful set of techniques that we know from scientific studies that are being done in my lab,\nJack Feldman's lab at UCLA, and others now that are very, very useful for reducing your stress\nresponse in real time. And here's how they work. These days, there seems\nto be a lot of interest in breath work. Breath work typically, is\nwhen you go and you sit down or you lie down and you\ndeliberately breathe in a particular way\nfor a series of minutes in order to shift your\nphysiology, access some states. And it does have some utility\nthat we're going to talk about, that is not what I'm talking about now. What I'm talking about when I\nrefer to physiological sighs, is the very real medical\nschool textbook relationship between the brain, the body, and the body as it relates\nto the breathing apparati, meaning the diaphragm\nand lungs and the heart. Let's take the hallmark\nof the stress response. The heart starts beating faster. Blood is shuttled to the\nbig muscles of the body to move you away from\nwhatever it is the stressor is or just make you feel like\nyou need to move or talk. Your face goes flushed, et cetera. Heart rate, many of us\nfeel is involuntary. Just kind of functions whether\nor not we're moving fast or moving slow. If you think about it, it's\nnot really purely autonomic because you can speed up\nyour heart rate by running or you can slow it down\nby slowing down your run. You can move to a walk or lie down. But that's indirect control. There is however, a way\nin which you can breathe that directly controls your heart rate through the interactions\nbetween the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system. Here's how it works. When you inhale, so whether or not it's through the nose or through the mouth, this skeletal muscle\nthat's inside your body called the diaphragm, it moves down. And that's because the lungs expand, the diaphragm moves down. Your heart actually\ngets a little bit bigger in that expanded space. There's more space for the heart. So, not your emotional\nheart getting bigger. I'm talking about your\nactual physical heart getting a little bit bigger. The volume grows. And as a consequence,\nwhatever blood is in there is now at a lower volume or\nmoving a little bit more slowly in that larger volume than\nit was before you inhaled. Okay? So more space, heart gets bigger. Blood moves more slowly. And there's a little group of neurons called the sinoatrial node\nin the heart that registers, believe it or not, those neurons pay attention to the rate of blood\nflow through the heart and send a signal up to the brain that blood is moving more\nslowly through the heart. The brain then sends a\nsignal back to the heart to speed the heart up. So, what this means is if you want your heart to beat faster, inhale longer, inhale more\nvigorously than your exhales. Now, there are a variety of\nways that one could do that, but it doesn't matter\nif it's through the nose or through the mouth. If your inhales are\nlonger than your exhales, you're speeding up your heart. If your inhales are more vigorous, so even if your inhales are\nshorter than your exhales, you are speeding up your heart rate. Now, the opposite is also true. If you want to slow your heart rate down, so stress response hits, you want to slow your heart rate down, what you want to do is again, capitalize on this\nrelationship between the body, meaning the diaphragm and\nthe heart and the brain. Here's how it works. When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up, which makes the heart\na little bit smaller. It actually gets a little more compact. Blood flows more quickly\nthrough that compact space sort of like just a pipe getting smaller. The sinoatrial node registers that blood is going more quickly, sends a signal up to the brain. And the parasympathetic nervous system, some neurons in your\nbrain stem send a signal back to the heart to slow the heart down. So, if you want to calm down quickly, you need to make your exhales longer and or more vigorous than your inhales. Now, the reason this is so attractive as a tool for controlling stress is that it works in real time. This doesn't involve a\npractice that you have to go and sit there and do\nanything separate from life. And we are going to get to emotion. Emotions and stress happen in real time. And so, while it's wonderful\nto have a breath work practice or to have the opportunity\nto get a massage or sit in a sauna or do\nwhatever it is that you do in order to set your stress\ncontrols in the right direction, having tools that you\ncan reach to in real time that require no learning, I mean, I had to teach it to\nyou, you had to learn that, but it doesn't require any plasticy to activate these pathways. So, if you're feeling stressed, you still need to inhale, of course, but you need to lengthen your exhales. ",

            "text": "Now, there's a tool\nthat capitalizes on this in a kind of unique\nway, a kind of a twist, which is the physiological sigh. The physiological sigh was\ndiscovered in the '30s. It's now been explored at\nthe neuro-biological level and mechanistically in far more detail by Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA. Also Mark Krasnow's lab at Stanford. And the physiological sigh\nis something that humans and animals do anytime they\nare about to fall asleep. You also do it throughout\nsleep from time to time when carbon dioxide, which we'll talk about in a moment, builds up too much in your system. And the physiological sigh is something that people naturally start\ndoing when they've been crying and they're trying to\nrecover some air or calm down when they've been sobbing very hard or when they are in\nclaustrophobic environments. However, the amazing\nthing about this thing that we call the diaphragm,\nthe skeletal muscle, is that it's an internal organ that you can control voluntarily, unlike your spleen or your\nheart or your pancreas where you can't just say, \"Oh,\nI want to make my pancreas turn out a little more insulin right now. I'm just going to do that\nwith my mind directly.\" You can't do that. You can do that by smelling\na really good donut or something, but you can't just do it directly. You can move your diaphragm\nintentionally, right? You can do it anytime you want. And it'll run in the background if you're not thinking about it. So, this incredible pathway that goes from brain to diaphragm through what's called the\nphrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. The phrenic nerve\ninnervates the diaphragm. You can control anytime you want. You can double up your inhales\nor triple up your inhales. You can exhale more than your inhales. Whatever you want to do. Such an incredible organ. And the physiological sigh is something that we do spontaneously. But when you're feeling stressed, you can do a double\ninhale, [inhales deeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, I just told you a minute ago that if you inhale more than you exhale, you're going to speed the heart rate up, which would promote more\nstress and activation. Now I'm telling you to\ndo a double inhale-exhale in order to calm down. And the reason is the double inhale-exhale which is the physiological sigh takes advantage of the fact\nthat when we do a double inhale, even if the second inhale is sneaking in just a tiny bit more air, because it's kind of hard to get\nto deep inhales back to back, you do big deep inhale and then another little\nones sneaking it in, the little sacks in your lungs. If you only have the lungs. Your lungs are just two big bags, but you've got millions of little sacks throughout the lungs that\nactually make the surface area of your lungs as big as a tennis court. It's amazing if we were\nto just spread out. Those tend to collapse as we get stressed. And carbon dioxide builds\nup in our bloodstream and that's one of the reasons\nwe feel agitated as well. So, and it makes us very jittery. I mean, there's some other\neffects of carbon dioxide I don't want to get into, but when you do the double inhale-exhale, the double inhale reinflates those little sacks of the lungs. And then when you do the long exhale, that long exhale is\nnow much more effective at reading your body and\nbloodstream of carbon dioxide, which relaxes you very quickly. My lab in collaboration\nwith David Spiegel's lab, David's the Associate Chair\nof Psychiatry at Stanford, are doing a study right now exploring how physiological sighs and other patterns of\nbreathing done deliberately can modulate the stress response and other things related to emotionality. Those work are ongoing. I want to be clear those\nstudies aren't done. But it's very clear from work in our labs, from work in Jack\nFeldman's lab and others, that the physiological sigh\nis the fastest, hardwired way for us to eliminate this\nstressful response in our body quickly in real time. And so, I'm excited to give you this tool because I think most people\nhave heard that mindfulness and meditation is good,\nexercise is good for us, we all need to be getting\nenough sleep, et cetera, but life happens. And when you find yourself in a position where you are more alert and activated than you would like to be, regardless of whether or not the stressor is relationship-based or it's\nfinancial or it's physical or anything like that, you can look to the physiological sigh because it bypasses a\nvery important feature of how we function, which is that it's very\nhard to control the mind with the mind, especially when we are in\nheightened states of activation. When you're very alert or very sleepy, it is very hard to use these\nso-called top-down mechanisms of intention and gratitude\nand all these things that are really powerful\ntools when we are not super activated and\nstressed or not super tired. But when we are anywhere in the range of very alert and stressed to very sleepy, physiological sighs are a powerful way of bringing our level of\nso-called autonomic activation, which just means our\nlevel of alertness down. And so, whether or not\nit's in line at the bank or whether or not you're\nwearing a mask nowadays or you're not, whatever the conditions\nmay be where you're at and your needs, when you're feeling stressed, the physiological sigh done\njust one to three times, it will be double inhale, exhale, ",

            "text": "double inhale, exhale maybe just two times will bring down your level\nof stress very, very fast. And as far as I know, it's the fastest way to accomplish that. An important note about\nthe physiological sigh or exhale-emphasized breathing for lowering the stress response. Many people worry that their heart rate does not come down fast enough. I want to tell you you do\nnot want your heart rate to reduce very fast. There's actually something\ncalled the vasovagal response, where people will stand up or they'll get up in\nthe middle of the night to use the bathroom and\nthen all of a sudden, they'll collapse, they'll faint. That's because the heart\nrate was reduced too much. Some people will see blood or they'll see something\nreally troubling and stressful and they'll pass out. That's an over-activation or an acceleration of\nthe calming response. They're not so stressed that they kind of fall\noff the cliff of stress. They get so stressed that the rebound mechanism\nfor calming themselves down goes too high, too fast. They calmed down too fast\nand they collapse and faint. And so, be aware that if you're going to use the physiological sigh or exhale-emphasized\nbreathing to calm down, that your heart rate will\ntake about 20 to 30 seconds to come down to baseline. And you may need to repeat\nthe physiological sigh a few times. So, that's an important note\nabout the use of breathing to control levels of stress. The other thing is that when\nyou decide to look to the body to control the mind, it does something else\nthat's very powerful. When you are stressed\nin your mind and body, so you're feeling really\nagitated, activated, and worried, and you use a tool like\nthe physiological sigh or exhale-emphasized breathing, you will notice that then\nyour brain and your mind becomes more available for\ncontrolling the stress response and reacting to it. Which is great because the\nsweet spot in life is to be, provided you're not trying to sleep, is to be alert and calm. ",

And what you'll find is that\nmost breath work protocols, the kind of stuff that's\ndone away from real life, that you set aside time and decide to do quote\nunquote, breath work, most of that works such\nthat if you're doing inhales that are longer and more\nvigorous than exhales, it tends to be activating and alert you.

So, I tell you this, not to\noverwhelm you with knowledge, but just know that when\nyou double up your inhales or you double up your exhales, you are activating this\nparafacial nucleus.

            "text": "that stress is bad. But in that conversation, unfortunately, it's eclipsed some of the\nreally positive things that stress does for us in the short-term. So, stress can be short-term,\nmedium-term, or long-term. Long-term stress is indeed bad for all the reasons I just\nmentioned and many others. But what's never actually been discussed is what stress is so terrific for, positive for in the short-term. And I think we tend to overlook\nthe important question, which is what is short-term\nand what is long-term? No one ever bothers to\ntell us what is chronic, what is acute. Right? Is it five minutes? Is it five days? Is it for the duration of final exams? Or is it for the duration of\na senior thesis in college? No one actually draws\nboundaries around this stuff or even general guidelines. And so, it's become a\nbit of a mess, frankly, to try and decipher this\nwhole space around stress. So, I'm going to try and\nclean some of this up for you based on what we know\nfrom the scientific data. First of all, acute stress, when the stress response hits, that is good for your immune system. I know that might be a\ntough pill to swallow, but it's absolutely true. In fact, stress often comes\nin the form of bacterial or viral infection. And the stress response\nis in part organized to combat bacterial and viral infection. There are pathways from\nthe same brain centers that activate these\nneurons in your spinal cord to make you feel like you want to move. There are other neurons in your brain that activate things like your spleen, which will deploy killer cells to go out and scavenge for incoming\nbacteria and viruses and try and eat them up and kill them. So, short-term stress and the release of adrenaline\nin particular or epinephrine, same thing, adrenaline and epinephrine, is good for combating infection. And this to me is just\nnot discussed enough. So, that's why I'm discussing it here. And it relates to a particular tool that many of you ask about, but I don't often get the\nopportunity to talk about in such an appropriate context. It's not that it's ever\ninappropriate to talk about, but what I'm about to talk\nabout now is the use of, again, respiration breathing to somewhat artificially\nactivate the stress response. And that will accomplish two things. Okay? I'll return to medium\nand long-term stress, but I want to say\nshort-term stress is good because the dilation of the pupils, the changes in the optics of the eyes, the quickening of the heart rate, the sharpening of your cognition. And in fact that short-term stress brings certain elements\nof the brain online that allow you to focus. Now, it narrows your focus. You're not good at seeing\nthe so-called big picture, but it narrows your focus. It allows you to do these, what I call duration path\noutcome types of analysis. It allows you to evaluate\nyour environment, evaluate what you need to do. It primes your whole system\nfor better cognition. It primes your immune\nsystem to combat infection. And that all makes sense when you think about that the fact that famine, thirst, bacterial infections,\nviral infections, invaders, all of this stuff liberates\na response in the body that's designed to get you to fight back against whatever stressor\nthat happens to be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. ",

            "text": "Again, the stress response is generic. The tool takes advantage of the fact that when adrenaline\nis released in the body from the adrenals, it has the effect of also liberating a lot of these killer cells\nfrom the immune organs, in particular from the spleen, but from elsewhere as well, and interactions with the lymphatic system that combat infection. The way this works in the\nreal world is best captured by a study that can be mapped back to so-called Wim Hof breathing. Now, Wim Hof breathing is so named after the so-called \"Iceman,\" Wim Hof. Wim Hof, of course, being this Dutch. He, I think he has self-titled Daredevil. And indeed he has many, many\nGuinness Book of World Records for things like swimming under icebergs and going up Kilimanjaro in his shorts and crossing the desert\nwithout water, et cetera.

            "text": "But there are two components\nto a sort of breathing protocol that he developed that was based also on what's called Tummo\nbreathing, T-U-M-M-O. So, before Wim, there was Tummo breathing. And many people call this now\nsuper oxygenation breathing. Although the breath work\naficionados will probably say, well, it's not super oxygenation because you're also blowing an\nawful lot of carbon dioxide. What I'm talking about here, regardless of whether or not\nit's called Wim Hof, Tummo, or super oxygenation, is\nrapid deliberate breathing. So, it's deliberate hyperventilation. Why would somebody want to do this? Well, deliberate hyperventilation\ndone for maybe 25 cycles. So inhale, exhale, inhale,\nexhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, it's done in through the nose out through the mouth. Although sometimes it's\njust through the mouth. If you do that for 15 breaths,\n20 breaths, 25 breaths, you will feel very alert. People who have anxiety will feel anxious. They might even have an anxiety attack. However, we need to ask why that kind of breathing feels that way. And it's because that\npattern of breathing, rapid movements of the diaphragm will liberate adrenaline\nfrom the adrenals. So, it's the release of adrenaline. I mentioned that Wim is\nalso called \"The Iceman.\" Well, that's because\nhe actually discovered this pattern of breathing, somewhat. And again, it maps back to Tummo breathing by going into cold water. When you go into cold water,\nthat too is a stressor and you liberate adrenaline\nin response to cold water. So, if you get into an\nice bath or a cold shower, you will immediately release\nadrenaline from your adrenals. Now, there are all sorts\nof things related to this about psychological control and stress thresholds\nthat we'll talk about, but I really want people to understand that when adrenaline is\nreleased in the body, you are in a better position\nto combat infections. And so, whether or not\nyou breathe very quickly in these cycles of 25 breaths and regardless of what you\ncall it, doesn't matter, adrenaline is released. If you take a cold shower,\nadrenaline is released. If you go into an ice bath deliberately, and even if you do it non-deliberately, adrenaline is released. You are mimicking the stress response. And that adrenaline serves to suppress or combat incoming infections. And this was beautifully shown in a study that was published in a very fine journal, the \"Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences for the US.\" It's literally called \"Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of USA\" to distinguish it from other proceedings of other national academies\nin other countries. The way the experiment went\nis that people were injected with endotoxin or in some\ncases they were injected with a bacterial wall\nthat mimics infection. It gives you a fever. It makes you feel nauseous. It makes you feel sick. It is not pleasant. Half of the people did a\nparticular pattern of breathing that looked very much like\nthe pattern of breathing I described a moment ago\nof doing 25 deep inhales and exhales followed by an\nexhale holding their breath. Then repeating 25 inhales,\nexhales holding their breath. So, this would look something like this, or if you're listening, it sounds like [inhaling and exhaling]. 25, 30 times, you'll\nstart feeling heated up. You'll start feeling\nthe adrenaline response. You're liberating adrenaline in your body. Then exhale, hold your\nbreath for 15 seconds and then repeat. And then typically, after doing three or four rounds of that, they would inhale very\ndeeply and hold their breath. Now, I want to emphasize\nnever ever, ever do this anywhere near water. People have passed out. So-called shallow water blackout. People have died. Don't do it in the bathtub. Don't do it the hot tub. Don't do it before swimming. Please don't do it anywhere near water. Please don't do it at all, unless you get clearance\nto do it from your doctor because there are some\npulmonary effects and whatnot. And the breath holds should\ndefinitely not be done by anyone that has glaucoma\npressure concerns for the eyes. But these repeated cycles of breathing that liberate adrenaline allowed the group that did that protocol to essentially experience zero symptoms from the ejection of this E.\ncoli, which is remarkable. They had much reduced or no symptoms. They didn't feel feverish. They didn't feel sick. They weren't vomiting, no\ndiarrhea, which is remarkable, but makes total sense when\nyou think about the fact that the short-term stress response there, ",

It's about capacity. And there are very simple\ntools, excellent tools that will allow us to modulate\nour capacity for stress. And they look a lot like\nthe tools I just described. They involve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our\nadrenaline is increased somewhat not to the extreme. And then when we feel\nflooded with adrenaline, and normally we would panic, it's about cognitively,\nmentally, emotionally calming ourselves and being comfortable with that response in our body. So, unlike trying to\nunify the mind and body and make it all calm or make it all alert, this is about dissociating\nmind and body in a healthy way. And what would this look like? Well, this is something I\nactually do as a practice because I mentioned before, you can use physiological\nsighs in real time, you can use the cyclic\nhyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection if you're\nfeeling kind of run down. And there's also a way in which you can use\nthings like cold showers, or if you exercise and you bring your\nheart rate up very high, you kind of go into that\nhigh-intensity realm where your heart is\nbeating a little bit harder than you're comfortable with\nand that you're just you feel, some people think it's lactic acid. No one can agree on this what the burn is, whether or not it's lactic acids or it's buildup of hydrogen or whatever. I don't want to get into\nthat, but we're all familiar with the intense feeling of\nyour muscles kind of burning because you're working\nvery hard physically. The key in those moments is\nto learn to relax the mind while the body is very activated. And what that tends to do, there's a limited amount\nof research on this, but what that tends to do is\nit tends to create a situation where what once felt like\na lot feels manageable. Okay? That you've raised your stress threshold or your stress capacity. One way that you can do this, and this is kind of fun, if it's approved by your physician and you're able to do this, you can bring your heart rate up. You can do this through an\nice bath if that's your thing or a cold shower or cyclic\noxygenation breathing or you could sprint or you\ncould go hard on the bike, whenever it is that\nbrings your heart rate up. And then what you want to do is you want to actually\ntry and calm the mind while your body is in this\nheightened state of activation. ",

            "text": "And the best way that\nI'm aware to do that, again goes back to\nphysiology, not psychology. When we are stressed, our pupils dilate. The effect of that pupil dilation is to create tunnel vision. It literally narrows our\nview of the visual world. We no longer see in Panorama. And there's some other effects as well. But that's because the visual system through this cranial nerve\nsystem that I described before is tethered and is part of\nthis autonomic nervous system. By deliberately dilating your gaze, meaning not moving your\nhead and eyes around, but by deliberately\ngoing from tunnel vision to broader panoramic vision, literally seeing more of\nyour environment all at once. You don't have to do what I'm\ndoing, which is not blinking. You're welcome to blink. But it means deliberately\ndilating your gaze so that you can see yourself\nin the environment you're in. It creates a calming effect on the mind because it releases a particular\ncircuit in the brainstem that's associated with\nalertness, aka stress. Now, this is very powerful. If you're running, for instance,\nand you're at max capacity or close to it, or you're kind of hitting like\n80, 90% of maximum on the bike and you dilate your gaze, what you'll find is the mind can relax while the body is in full output. And this relates to work\nthat in various communities, people are working with this\nin the sports community, military community, et cetera. But it's a form, not really\nof stress inoculation, it's more about raising stress threshold so that the body is going to continue to be in a high alertness,\nhigh reactivity mode, high output, but the mind is calm. And so, this isn't about\nunifying mind and body. This is actually about using body to bring up your level of activation, then dissociating, not the clinical dissociation\nkind of disorders, but dissociating the mental\nor emotional response from what's going on in your body. And over time, so if you\ndo this a couple of times, you don't have to do this every workout, but if you do this every\nmaybe once a week or so, you start being comfortable at these higher activation states. What once felt overwhelming\nand like a lot of work, now is manageable. It feels tolerable. So, that's for navigating\nmedium-term stress. Now, there are other tools as well, but we don't want to go over 90 minutes because 90 minutes is\none old trading cycle. I was trying to keep these\npodcasts to one on trading cycle, in case you haven't noticed, so you can derive\nmaximum benefit from them based on all trading and\ncycle principles of learning. So, I don't want to go into\nevery little bit of this. And I want to make sure\nwe get to emotions. But I want to emphasize that\nthese medium-term stressors, of, \"Oh, it's been a hard\nmonth, or hard week.\" Stanford's on the quarter system. So 10 weeks or semester.

In fact, you ideally, you\nwould have your stress go up various times throughout the day, but it would never stay elevated and it would never prevent you from getting a good night's sleep.

I would say for me, three,\nfour nights out of the month, no matter what I do, I take on too much or something happens in life is life and I don't get the best night's sleep that I would like to get. For many of you, it's 30 nights per month. For some of you, it's\nzero nights per month. And congratulations to you\nzero nights per month people.

Earlier, I talked about how breathing can modulate heart rate through this loop that includes the brain and the parasympathetic nervous system. I don't think I mentioned this, and I want to make sure that I mentioned that breathing controlling heart rate through the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic nervous system is the basis of what's called\nHRV, heart rate variability. And we know that heart\nrate variability is good. You don't want your heart\nrate chronically elevated or chronically low. A lot of people think, \"Oh, I want a really nice low heart rate.\" And indeed, if you're in shape, the stroke volume of your\nheart will be greater and you can have a nice slow heart rate. Years ago when I was running regularly, I think my heart rate\nwas down to like 50 or 60 or something like that. That's great. But, and now it's higher than that because I'm running a little bit less. But everyone needs to determine\nwhat's right for them. But you don't really want your heart rate to be chronically low or chronically high. Both are bad. We know that chronic\nstress, elevated stress and especially in the\nso-called type A personalities creates heart disease, the leading killer of for\nin most, every country, but in particular in the US. Because of the way that adrenaline impacts those blood vessels\nor constricting some and dilating others, it's just that kind of hypertension, chronic hypertension is just bad. And so, chronic stress truly is bad. I want to really make that clear because I emphasized a lot of what some of the\npositive effects of stress.

The data really points to the\nfact that social connection and certain types of social\nconnection in particular are what are going to mitigate\nor reduce long-term stress. And this is a particularly\nimportant issue nowadays where we have all these proxies or surrogates for social connection. We're online and texting\nwith people a lot, so we can feel connected. Like the plane's about to take off and everyone's texting each other whether or not they have\nfear of flying or not. They're like, \"Okay, see you. Love you.

Serotonin again, is a neuromodulator. Neuromodulators are a little bit like playlists in the brain. They tend to amplify\nor bias the likelihood that certain brain\ncircuits and body circuits are going to be activated\nand that others will not. Serotonin generally, and I realize I'm speaking\nvery generally here, but it generally gives\nus feelings of wellbeing. At very high levels, it makes us feel blissed\nand it tends to make us feel like we have enough in\nour immediate environment. This is why some of the side\neffects of antidepressants that elevate serotonin, and actually can help a lot of people with depressive symptoms. But the side effects associated with drugs that increase serotonin\ntend to be reduced affect. They tend to kind of blunt affect or make people feel like\ntheir libido is lower. Desire goes down because the\nbody has so much serotonin and the brain has so much serotonin, that one feels like they have enough. But serotonin, pharmacology aside or taking antidepressants\naside a topic for another time, serotonin tends to make us feel good. When we see somebody that\nwe recognize and trust, serotonin is released in the brain. And that has certain positive\neffects on the immune system and on other systems of\nneural repair and synopsis and things that really reinforce\nconnections in the brain and prevent that long-term\nwithering of connections. So, serotonin is tied\nto social connection. Now, social connection\ncan take many forms. As many of you know, I am\nvery attached to my dog. I hope he's attached to me. He's asleep most of the time. So, I don't know. And even if he was awake, I don't really know what I would ask him. But he seems more or less to\nbe attached to me as well. And there's no scientific evidence that it has to be human-human attachment. I do have attachments to humans as well. But you can have\nattachments to other people. Some of those can be romantic attachments. They could be familial\nattachments that are non-romantic, friendship, pets, even\nattachments to things that just delight us. One of the things that really can mitigate against the long-term negative effects of chronic long-term stress\nisn't just having fun. We hear all this stuff, \"You\nneed to play and have fun.\" That can be a little\nbit of a tough concept, especially for the hard driving people or people that are stressed, but having a sense of delight, a sense of really enjoying\nsomething that you see and engage in, witness, or participate in, that is associated with\nthe serotonin system. And certainly, play is\none of those things. Social connection of various forms. Those are things to invest in. ",

I have a friend who struggles with this and oftentimes the\nconversations just circle back to the fact that when you\nwant social connection, you often have to be more flexible.

Taqi Kynan is a molecule\nthat makes us more fearful, paranoid, and impairs our immune system. And so, Taqi Kynan is like this\ninternal punishment signal. It's like our body and\nour brain telling us, \"You're not spending enough time with people that you really trust. You're not spending time doing things that you really enjoy.\" And I often think about\nTaqi Kynan for myself because I'm pretty hard driving. I have a lot of pursuits.

And this is why long meals\nwith friends or family where there are, we'll talk about phones in a moment, but where there's no intrusions, or even if there are, just\nfeeling like we are connected suppresses Taqi Kynan.

There is actually no such\nthing as adrenal burnout under normal conditions. The adrenals have enough adrenaline to support 200 years of\nstress for better, for worse. The concept of adrenal burnout has origins in the work of Nobel\nPrize winner, Hans Selye, who actually discovered what he called the general\nadaptation syndrome. He discovered a lot of\nthings about stress. He did some phenomenal work\nthat turned out to be true. That we have stressors. There's something called distress. He talked about eustress,\nwhich is positive stress. Eustress has never really caught on in the kind of more general discussion.

Although many of you may feel exhausted after chronic stress, there isn't really a physiological\nexhaustion that happens. And that eventually got picked up and ran with the general public. And they talk about adrenal burnout. Too much coffee, adrenal burnout. You hear all this stuff. There is no such thing as adrenal burnout. The adrenals don't burn out. There is something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, which is a real physiological problem where some people have\nvery impaired adrenals and they can't produce adrenaline. And melatonin taken at very high levels for periods of time that are too long can cause suppression of the cortisol and epinephrine released from the adrenals and can create a kind of pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, be aware of melatonin for that reason. Please, I'm trying, I alone can't get rid of\nthe phrase adrenal burnout.

They report in across six\nstudies, 14.5 to 27.9 reduction in cortisol in otherwise healthy,\nbut stressed individuals. Now, I don't know about kids. You have to look at what it\nsays on various supplements. Most things here are being done in adults. So, please check carefully. But this is great. I mean, the opportunity for me anyway, to be able to take something that can help me reduce my cortisol so that I don't get some of the\nlong-term effects of stress. And I'm not going to take\nashwagandha year round. I would only do this if I was feeling like I wasn't managing my short\nand medium-term stress well. So, I don't take it on a regular basis. I do take it when I'm in these times when things are particularly stressful. It has their five other studies\nthat show reduced stress. So, that's not cortisol measurements, but things like fatigue,\ncognitive impairment, et cetera. It does lower total cholesterol, which may or may not be good\nor bad for you up to 10%. So, some people don't want\ntheir cholesterol lowered. Some people might. Cholesterol, we'll talk about\nthis in a month on hormones, but cholesterol is the molecule\nfrom which testosterone and estrogen and cortisol for\nthat matter are synthesized. So, you don't want to get\nyour cholesterol so low, then there are all sorts\nof negative effects, but you don't want it too high either. Mild effects in good clinical studies on reducing depression, probably associated with\nthe effects on stress and some other things as well. So, ashwagandha is something\nI use from time to time. It's kind of interesting. ",

            "text": "Of course, diet, exercise,\nsleep for long-term stress. And now we're finally in\na position to talk about what we have set out to\ndo from the beginning, which is spend the month on emotions. It was very important\nthat we discuss stress and we discuss in the\ncontext of short, medium, and long-term stress. That we discuss tools for\nshort-term, medium-term, and long-term control. I don't really want to\nsay mitigation of stress. Stress is going to happen. But our ability to modulate\nand control stress in real time offline using tools such as respiration, using tools such as dilation of gaze, using tools like social\nconnection, maybe some supplements, certainly take care of your sleep and nutrition and exercise. Again, tons of resources and information in the sleep episodes. So, you can look there. We will do a month on hormones,\non exercise, et cetera. But let's talk about emotions because in subsequent episodes, we're going to talk about OCD, we're going to talk about depression, we're going to talk about mania, we're going to be talking about dopamine and all sorts of things. But at the core of\nemotions is this question, what is an emotion? Well, it's complex. There isn't a single brain area\nfor any one of these things that we call emotions. My framework, and I\nthink the modern science, both psychology and neuroscience\nis pretty well-aligned with what Lisa Feldman\nBarrett has taught about. Now, Lisa's at Northeastern University. She runs a big lab there. She's a world expert in emotion. She's written two books\nthat are really wonderful. One is \"How Emotions Are Made,\"\nwhich was her first book. The second one is \"Seven and\na Half Facts About the Brain.\" It's a wonderful book as well. It came out more recently. I hosted Lisa on an Instagram live once. Maybe we'll get her here on\nthe podcast if we're lucky. We don't agree on everything about the neuroscience of emotions, but I subscribed to most everything that I've heard Lisa say. In particular, the fact that\nemotions are context-dependent. There's a cultural dependence, et cetera. I look at things mainly through the lens of\nphysiology and neuroscience and kind of low-level circuitry. And one way to think about emotions that I think is consistent and I think Lisa would generally approve, I can't speak for her, but I would hope she\nwould generally approve of this description, is that when our internal\nstate of stress or calm matches the demands on us or is mismatched from the demands on us, we tend to interpret those as good or bad. Let me give you an example. If I am feeling very anxious,\nvery stressed inside, and I have a lot to do, that doesn't feel good, but\nit's really no different than if I'm very tired\nand I have a lot to do because there's this mismatch. I'm not in the right internal state, my internal state is incorrect rather, to meet the demands that\nare being placed upon me. So, in both cases, whether I'm too tired or I'm too stressed to\ndo what I need to do, the valence, meaning the\nvalue that I assigned to that is I don't feel good. It's not a good situation\nand I don't feel good. Now, I might call it stressed,\nI might call it anxious, I might call it worried, I might\ncall it a number of things, but it's not good. However, when I'm tired\nand I want to fall asleep, well then I feel good because\nthat's what the demand is. I need to go to sleep and I'm tired. If I'm wide awake and\nI need to fall asleep, then that's not good. And then the brain tends\nto go down the direction of interpreting the\nsituation as a bad one. So, while the discussion around\nemotions is far more nuanced and more elaborate than this, one way to think about your\nrelationship to emotions is whether or not your internal state is matching the demands that are upon you. So, in that way, we don't\nreally place so much value on whether or not we're\nfeeling alert or sleepy. We only place value on\nwhether or not that alertness whether or not it's\nfull-blown stress or not or our sleepiness, whether\nor not we're falling asleep or just a little bit drowsy, whether or not that matches\nthe conditions that we face. And it's a useful framework to have. And it's the reason in part why I spent this last\nhour and a half or so talking about stress and\nhow to control stress. One reason we did that is because I think it's\na valuable opportunity to learn some tools and understand stress and really learn how to\ntake control of stress, which I think we could all benefit from doing regardless of age. The other reason is that\nwhen you start to understand that you have this kind of\nsee-saw system in your body, this autonomic nervous\nsystem that takes you from alert and calm to\nstressed to full-blown panic, it has that capacity, or from sleepy and drowsy\nto passing out tired to God forbid, let's hope\nnever, but a coma, right? That you're basically on\nthis see-saw all the time. And where you are on that\nsee-saw of alertness or calmness positions you to be in better reaction to the demands that you face. Whether or not the thing that you face is a need to fall asleep or to\nlisten quietly and not react. You now know, for instance, that if your job is to take feedback, when maybe you're going\nin for a job evaluation or you're in a relationship where there was a call for a discussion and somebody needs to talk\nto you about something and we need to talk about something, you're going to there you're like, \"Goodness, this is going to be rough.\" Learning to reduce that\nstress response a little bit so that you are in a position to hear the information better, and remember, from a previous episode, if you close your eyes, you'll be able to actually\nfocus on the information better. There's your permission to\nnot look someone directly in the eye when they talk to you if you really want to hear\nwhat they have to say. You will be able to modulate\nthat stress response ",

            "text": "and lean into life better. You will be able to react to\nthings in a more effective way and to not be reactive. And this is really one of the\nimportant things to me anyway, is that so much of the\nlanguage around psychology, which I think is a wonderful field, but pop psychology in\nparticular is be responsive, not reactive. Well, great. But then how does one do that? Well, one does that by modulating their short-term\nstress response in real time. Not by saying, \"Hold\non, I need to meditate. Hold on, I need a massage and then I can have this conversation.\" By modulating the reactivity in real time. How does one, for instance, be mindful? Which is a beautiful concept,\nbut how are you mindful? Well, I don't know, when\nI'm moving through my day, a lot of times I'm just\ntrying to get things done. And as soon as I start monitoring\nand seeing what I'm doing and kind of third-personing\nwhat I'm doing, it actually takes me\nout of the effectiveness and experience of what I'm doing. So for me, sometimes that mindfulness, that observer, as they call it, is something that doesn't help me. It actually hinders me. What's important to me is\nto be able to work and focus and then to be able to disengage. To be able to do a non-sleep depressed or to be able to still fall asleep even though I've been\nworking hard until 9:30 to put my head down at 10 o'clock and be out cold sleeping by 10:02. That's possible if you can learn to control this stress response. And to do that, we can't\nuse the mind to control. The mind, we need tools. And so, a lot of the people being grumpy or anxious or depressed, a lot of that, provided it's not for some\nunderlying neurochemical reason that's chronic, a lot of that come from\nbeing poorly rested, from overworked, from\nfeeling like the world is bearing down on us. And so, rather than take\na subjective view of this, I take the view of objective physiology. What can we do that's anchored\nto these neuronal systems in our body, in our brain, in our eyes, in our diaphragm, et cetera, and look to those as tools leavers that we can pull on and push and maneuver through life in a way ",

So, I think that ought to set the stage for where we're headed next, which is to talk about all the things that you normally think of\nwhen you think of emotions, like happiness, like awe, like joy. And we will get into some of that. But all of that rests\nfirmly on the foundation of this thing we call the\nautonomic nervous system. This stress modulation. This calming modulation system. And again, whether or not\nyou're activated or you're calm is not good or bad, it\ndepends on the situation. Certainly, when you want to fall asleep, being activated isn't good. When you have work to do,\nbeing activated is great. So, I hope today you were able to take a slightly different view of\nthis thing that we call stress. Not just see it as evil,\nbut see it as powerful and useful in certain contexts. Great for us in certain contexts and problematic in other contexts. And as well to think\nabout the various tools that I've presented that\ncan allow you to adjust and modulate your internal\nlevels of alertness or calmness so that you can lean more\neffectively into life, which includes sleep and social connection and the work you have to do. And of course, acknowledges\nthat the events in the world are beyond our control. What's in our control\nis how we react to them. Something that's commonly said\nin the wellness and self-help and psychology world, but for which there often\naren't as many concrete tools that we can really look\nto and trust in real time.

As always, I always cover a lot of tools that are zero-cost tools that don't involve\ningesting anything at all, behavioral tools. But I mentioned some supplements that I particularly find useful. With supplements, it's\na complicated landscape, often because many supplement companies don't put in the bottle what they say is in\nthe particular product. We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne is a supplement company that we know to have the\nhighest levels of stringency. It's used by the Mayo Clinic. It's used by all the\nmajor sports organizations for that particular reason and because their quality\nstandards are exceptionally high.
